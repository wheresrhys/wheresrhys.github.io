It goes a little like this:\n\n> Bugs happen in code, so the more code you have the more bugs will happen, so the less code you write the better, ergo, write less code\n\nThere's some truth in this, but I feel it's it's been repeated enough to become dogma. Bugs _do_ happen in code, but more accurately, bugs happen when code runs up against an unexpected invocation. Does writing less code protect you from this? Not necessarily.\n\nGiven a software system there are certain tasks that need completing e.g. \n\n> Submit credit card details and receive confirmation or rejection\n\nor \n\n> Submit a friend request and receive a humiliating rejection\n\nFor these two examples it's certainly possible to pick out lots of similarites between the two tasks, to the point where those similarities could be abstracted away into a common library, leading to less duplication and redundancy, _less code_ and - abracadabra - fewer bugs!\n\nExcept that's clearly madness. Despite some superficial, and possibly some deep, similarities, the two tasks have great potential to diverge from their current requirements, leading, in time, to greater complexity in having to support both, lack of good domain knowledge in the team[s] that maintain the code and, ultimately, more bugs.\n\nSo why is this 'less code' bad, and other 'less code' good? How can we find our way to a good 'less code'.\n\nI think it lies in whether the simplification in the code has a knock on effect on simplifying the space of tasks the application models. In the example above, a single library with lots of conditionals to branch between the credit card and friend transactions can hardly be said to be simpler conceptually than having two separate libraries. If anything it's more complex - rather than having two tasks that do some similar things, we now have a single task which repeatedly diverges and converges in its behaviour.\n\nSo how could we reduce our code footprint *and* reduce complexity? The answer, as is often the case in good programming, lies in abstraction and composition. \nFor the example above, the way to exploit the similarities between the two tasks isn't to blindly merge the two code-bases at every point of contact, but rather to identify which of the similarities map well to higher abstractions, e.g. both the credit card and friend transactions could piggy back on to shared authentication, queueing, and UI systems but - and this is crucial - these systems should contain no information about the systems (friend, credit card) that call them. There is a world of difference between `CreditCardAndFriendSharedStuff` and `AuthSystem`, `QueueSystem` and `UISystem`.\n\nIn addition to having less code repetition (though not necessarily fewer lines of code at first), this will also have the effect of reducing the complexity of tasks to be handled - a greater number of small tasks is typically easier to reason about and maintain than larger complex tasks. \n\nSo is this what people are getting at when they urge writing 'less code'?

It goes a little like this:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Bugs happen in code, so the more code you have the more bugs will happen, so the less code you write the better, ergo, write less code\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>There’s some truth in this, but I feel it’s it’s been repeated enough to become dogma. Bugs \u003Cem>do\u003C/em> happen in code, but more accurately, bugs happen when code runs up against an unexpected invocation. Does writing less code protect you from this? Not necessarily.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Given a software system there are certain tasks that need completing e.g.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Submit credit card details and receive confirmation or rejection\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>or\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Submit a friend request and receive a humiliating rejection\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>For these two examples it’s certainly possible to pick out lots of similarites between the two tasks, to the point where those similarities could be abstracted away into a common library, leading to less duplication and redundancy, \u003Cem>less code\u003C/em> and - abracadabra - fewer bugs!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Except that’s clearly madness. Despite some superficial, and possibly some deep, similarities, the two tasks have great potential to diverge from their current requirements, leading, in time, to greater complexity in having to support both, lack of good domain knowledge in the team[s] that maintain the code and, ultimately, more bugs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So why is this ‘less code’ bad, and other ‘less code’ good? How can we find our way to a good ‘less code’.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it lies in whether the simplification in the code has a knock on effect on simplifying the space of tasks the application models. In the example above, a single library with lots of conditionals to branch between the credit card and friend transactions can hardly be said to be simpler conceptually than having two separate libraries. If anything it’s more complex - rather than having two tasks that do some similar things, we now have a single task which repeatedly diverges and converges in its behaviour.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So how could we reduce our code footprint \u003Cem>and\u003C/em> reduce complexity? The answer, as is often the case in good programming, lies in abstraction and composition.\nFor the example above, the way to exploit the similarities between the two tasks isn’t to blindly merge the two code-bases at every point of contact, but rather to identify which of the similarities map well to higher abstractions, e.g. both the credit card and friend transactions could piggy back on to shared authentication, queueing, and UI systems but - and this is crucial - these systems should contain no information about the systems (friend, credit card) that call them. There is a world of difference between \u003Ccode>CreditCardAndFriendSharedStuff\u003C/code> and \u003Ccode>AuthSystem\u003C/code>, \u003Ccode>QueueSystem\u003C/code> and \u003Ccode>UISystem\u003C/code>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In addition to having less code repetition (though not necessarily fewer lines of code at first), this will also have the effect of reducing the complexity of tasks to be handled - a greater number of small tasks is typically easier to reason about and maintain than larger complex tasks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So is this what people are getting at when they urge writing ‘less code’?

It’s not necessarily easy to achieve — the industry hasn’t done itself any favours over the last 40 years — but with a bit of effort teams can become more diverse. At the FT we work with code bootcamps, such as [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) and [CodeYourFuture](https://codeyourfuture.io/), who already do a lot of effective work to encourage under-represented groups into tech. We also try to alter our profile to appeal to people who don’t think of themselves as ‘code ninjas’, and place an emphasis on trying to be an [inclusive place to work](https://roles.ft.com/), with a work-life balance that will appeal to those not totally obsessed with code.\n\nSo, it’s not a lala-land moon-wish to work in a diverse workplace. But why would you _want_ to? Why would you rate diversity above other criteria when looking for a new job, or deciding how you recruit to your current company?\n\nThere are lots of arguments out there around the [benefits to the business](https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/244/top-10-benefits-of-diversity-in-the-workplace-infographic-included). Also about a duty to support a fair and equal society, being an ally and all that. All those points I agree with, but I can’t help feeling they are only really persuasive for people who are already somewhat persuaded. So I’m going to appeal to a simpler, more personal argument for diverse workplaces — **you will be happier**.\n\nBy and large developers don’t fit the stereotype of antisocial nerd. That’s true of where I work now and my contention is that, beneath the surface, it’s true everywhere I’ve worked. The difference being that at the FT, where diversity has been worked hard at for years, the people are so wonderfully different from one another that accidentally falling into the trap of conforming to the norm — that Shawshank Redemption “insitutionalization” I mentioned earlier — is impossible; there _is_ no norm. There isn’t this invisible template that you find yourself fitting into. I can honestly say the FT is the first tech job I’ve had where I feel like I can really be myself, and that’s a wonderful thing. Diversity plays a big part in that.\n\nBut the dev cultures which have existed for decades won’t disappear overnight, and they can be — often unintentionally — hostile to newcomers. Even at the FT, where we strive to be inclusive, it’s definitely still a problem. I spoke to a female code bootcamp graduate we’d recently taken on, and she was convinced we practise positive discrimination (we don’t — she, and all the other women we’ve hired, have just been the best candidates). It really brought home to me how big a cultural shift still needs to happen.

By the end of 2018 it felt fairly feature complete, and a recent overhaul of the documentation meant support requests from confused users were reduced down to a trickle.\n\nI looked forward to a 2019 where I could put my feet up. \n\nThings did not, however, work out that way. \n\nSo, I think it'd be illuminating to share what goes into maintaining an open source project, even during the \"quiet\" periods. What are the forces that drag it away from a steady state?\n\nI've waded through 2019's pull requests, issues and releases, and here are the leading causes of me not putting on a pair of fetch-mock branded flip-flops and sipping nodejs pina-colada in front of an npm red sunset.\n\n## 1. ECMAScript does not stand still\n\nAs a user of the new features continually being added to the JS language, it's been a pretty positive experience, from the [dawning of arrow functions](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2016/09/19/indenting-es6.html), right through to the eagerly anticipated [optional chaining proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining). I am also in awe of the power Babel and related tools give us to upgrade the web seamlessly.\n\nBut as a package maintainer - an isomorphic package, no less - this can be a headache. Most of the JS ecosystem can be made to run in a wide variety of environments, using different JS runtimes. If I want fetch-mock to satisfy its users, then it must be able to keep pace with the environments in which JS runs. \n\nfetch-mock supports JS all the way back to ES5, shipping a transpiled and polyfilled ES5 build. Without explicitly including the polyfills in the source code, it would [break for some users' toolchains](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/251#issuecomment-360100132). A consequence of this is that the built files required the core-js polyfill library at version 2, but fetch-mock did not declare it as a dependency (babel, which added the dependency to the built files, was a development dependency).\n\nIn mid 2019 this previously benign oversight became problematic. A new major version of corejs was released, and projects that used this (often required transitively via their toolchain) could [no longer bundle their tests](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/419). Things were about to get a whole lot worse too, because the release of [Angular 8](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases/tag/8.0.0), which [shipped with a babel/core-js upgrade](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/419#issuecomment-497056398), meant that fetch-mock would be incompatible with Angular. \n\nOne of my users eventually [submitted a fix](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/432/files), but not before my having to [reject other attempts](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/444). This whole episode did stir me to further work, and I ended up giving fetch-mock a tooling overhaul to [follow babel best practice](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/429), upgrade core-js and add [support for ES modules](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/446). \n\nBecause of the kind of tooling clashes I've outlined above, I felt it was unwise to release these changes as a minor, so I went through quite a rigorous process of creating a new major version, inviting comment from users on various alpha releases. Later in 2020 I anticipate another major version to [rewrite the source using ES modules](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/471), and [tidy up some tooling](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/476) I missed this time around. That'll be fun.\n\n## 2. Jest, my nemesis\nJest is the test runner du jour, with built-in mocking support that works very differently, and less transparently, than previous tools. On the last day of 2018 I received a [bug report](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/407) that fetch-mock did not work with Jest on the server side. By the end of January I had [found a solution](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/commit/f676cf48d9e78fe1784c384374be070454db726d#diff-68e10cdfbf331459d2bb4ca1ccdf4f79), but it was far from ideal. \n\nThroughout 2019 I have racked my brains and continually revisited the problem. I've raised issues on other libraries [asking for help](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/566), raised issues with Jest, and invested a lot of time stepping through its source code and documentation, and experimenting with a variety of workarounds.\n\nThis was easily the most difficult problem to solve this year, and has literally kept me awake at night. It took _11 months_ to hit upon the [5 lines of ugly code](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/486/files#diff-e6a5b42b2f7a26c840607370aed5301a) that gave me closure... almost - Once released, it smoothed the way to writing a wrapper for fetch-mock that contains a more idiomatic way of inspecting fetch calls in Jest, [fetch-mock-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-mock-jest). That took at least another week of evenings to complete.\n\nAll this anguish, and I don't even _like_ Jest! I think it's pretty over-rated, and it wouldn't surprise me if JS fashion will swing back towards more composable, less black-boxy tools. But in the meantime, I have to be compatible with the toolchains fetch-mock users are using.\n\n## 3. Abortable fetches\nOne thing I'm really proud of is how much of the fetch API fetch-mock covers. This does, however, mean that when the fetch API grows, fetch-mock must grow with it. This year was particularly busy in this respect because of the more widespread use of [abortable fetch](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#aborting-ongoing-activities).\n\nUsers first started asking for support for abortable fetch in [mid 2018](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/328), and support was added in October 2018. This year, what's followed has been a bunch of minor niggles. Fortunately, most fixes have been [submitted](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/418) [by](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/485) [users](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/473) (for which I'm grateful - you fetch aborters are a nice bunch :-) ), and I've mainly had to put effort into reading the spec to verify their PRs address valid concerns, and on one occasion passed on a [request for spec compliance to node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/657). \n\nIt does serve me right* that I had to deal with all this because I [opened the original issue](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/20) which led to the [formal discussion](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/27) that eventually resulted in Abortable fetches.\n\n*I'm not seriously taking credit for abortable fetch.\n\n## 4. Types\nI don't know if anyone has heard of Typescript, but apparently it's the hip new way to write code that can run on Windows 95 and other platforms. Its killer feature is that it developers can be 100x more productive and never ever write bugs. On the downside, it makes libraries 100% unusable if they don't ship with types.\n\nI exaggerate, and am in fact Typescript-curious, but I do agree with my colleague Rowan's appraisal:\n\n>[Never be the person who opens an issue on a JavaScript project complaining that you can’t use it because it has no TypeScript types](https://twitter.com/rowanmanning/status/1194169675648831488)\n\nEventually somebody [stepped up to the plate](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/434) for fetch-mock. Fortunately, the definitely typed project had already written [fetch-mock types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/fetch-mock), but I still had to either learn typescript properly (yeah, right!) or reverse engineer the tooling from definitely typed to work in fetch-mock. After that [initial outlay](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/459), I now have the maintenance overhead of keeping types up to date. It's a lot to ask of somebody giving their time for free.\n\nSo, my feedback to the Typescript community at large is, unless you're a Typescript novice, *never* raise an issue asking for types without making a serious offer* to write and maintain them on an ongoing basis.\n\nNever!\n\n*I'm grateful to [Dave Cooper](https://twitter.com/davewritescodes) for  making such an offer.\n\n## 5. Cloudflare workers\n\nAs mentioned in section 1 above, fetch-mock supports a vast range of environments, both server and client side. Cloudflare workers - inspired by the Service Worker standard, and amazingly [more than two years old](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-everywhere-cloudflare-workers/) - took fetch for its first foray into edge computing. Cloudflare's [non-standard extensions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/apis/request/#the-cf-object) meant that eventually an [issue was raised](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/430) asking for fetch-mock to support this new environment. I was happy to oblige, especially as all it meant was [reading some specs](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/431#issuecomment-496665247) and [merging a PR](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/431/files). \n\nI've spent a lot of time in recent years writing VCL code to run on the edge, and I found it quite satisfying to learn that fetch-mock was helping others embrace edge computing.\n\n## 6. Security\nI've been lucky when it comes to security issues (although, I do try to avoid adding too many dependencies, which helps matters), and only [one pull request](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/467) was solely to fix a vulnerability. I feel it's still worth a mention because it's another important responsibility package maintainers have.\n\n## Interval\n\nI'm barely half way through my summary of the year, but think I'll pause here to reflect on one very important thing that all the above have in common - They have very little to do with fetch-mock. \n\nNo bugs, no new features, no documentation mistakes, no assisting people with the API. \n\nThey are all tasks that the rising tide of the JS ecosystem has floated up to my door. It reminds me of this scene from The Ring:\n\n> Doctor: You don't want to hurt anyone.\n> \n> Samara: But I do, and I'm sorry, it won't stop.\n\nIt won't stop. It will _never_ stop. This - at a bare minimum - is what maintaining a reasonably well-used open source project entails. Still want in?\n\nNow, on with the show.\n\n## 7. Skip to the end...\nPart of me would like to catalog all the other issues, large and small, in full detail, but I doubt it'd make for interesting reading, so here's a summary:\n\n- 6 non-trivial feature requests, of which [1 was rejected](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/454), 4 were implemented by me, and 1 was implemented by my [erstwhile colleague](https://twitter.com/simonleggsays). \n- 3 significant documentation rewrites, either of content or structure, and at one point [completely breaking the docs site](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/417).\n- 21 support requests (8 of which reated to old version of the library) ranging from fairly cryptic issues with little information on how to reproduce, to [uncovering](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/415) that there's a bug in how ES proxies are polyfilled in IE11.\n- 6 user PRs merged, mainly fixing typos in the docs.\n- 7 bug fixes \n- 4 issues with my build and release tooling\n- 2 sizeable refactors and evolutions of the API \n\nIt's perhaps difficult to appreciate how much work went into that when it's expressed in such a condensed form. Maybe a useful heuristic is to imagine that all these tickets arrived in _your_ team's backlog. How much time and effort would it take? Would _you_ do it for free?\n\n## 8. Chains\n\nAt times, it's quite satisfying maintaining a successful open source project, and during those times knowing that people all over the world use something I made is reward enough. But for much of this year, during the summer in particular, it became a burden. \n\nAll the chores I've mentioned above took a significant amount of time to implement or otherwise deal with. But what the list of tasks above does not capture is the cognitive load of dealing with one, or a few, expectant users on a particular problem, while also considering the thousands of others that use the project. It's a lot of pressure. \n\nIn the past I've accidentally broken features, and while I've not been abused for it (though some users could do with learning some manners), it is quite stressful. For much of the summer, I carried the dilemma of how to resolve the core-js & babel issue around with me, watching the rising tide of upvotes from impatient Angular users. Eventually I succumbed to the weight of responsibility and reluctantly spent my autumn evenings clearing the backlog.\n\nAnd this. Was supposed to be. A quiet year. \n\n## 9. Funding\nHopefully I've persuaded you that maintaining an open source project is a big commitment. Others have written about the need to fund OSS properly, and they are damn right! \n\nSo I urge you to run `npm fund` and find out which maintainers would appreciate some of your tech dollars. And, further, I urge you to persuade _your employer_ to do likewise. You, personally, may get some utility from using the tools I and others write, but your employer makes money from it. If they don't already, it's high time they put something back.\n\nYou could start here, by donating to my charity of choice, [refugee support](https://www.justgiving.com/refugee-support-europe).\n\nCheers.","src/data/blog-posts/2020-01-13-oss-on-ice.md","f3b1aff751ebf01b",{"html":95,"metadata":96},"\u003Cp>I’ve been developing and maintaining \u003Ca href=\"http://wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">fetch-mock\u003C/a> - a widely used npm package for mocking http requests - for about 5 years.

I am also in awe of the power Babel and related tools give us to upgrade the web seamlessly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But as a package maintainer - an isomorphic package, no less - this can be a headache. Most of the JS ecosystem can be made to run in a wide variety of environments, using different JS runtimes. If I want fetch-mock to satisfy its users, then it must be able to keep pace with the environments in which JS runs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>fetch-mock supports JS all the way back to ES5, shipping a transpiled and polyfilled ES5 build. Without explicitly including the polyfills in the source code, it would \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/251#issuecomment-360100132\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">break for some users’ toolchains\u003C/a>. A consequence of this is that the built files required the core-js polyfill library at version 2, but fetch-mock did not declare it as a dependency (babel, which added the dependency to the built files, was a development dependency).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In mid 2019 this previously benign oversight became problematic. A new major version of corejs was released, and projects that used this (often required transitively via their toolchain) could \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/419\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">no longer bundle their tests\u003C/a>.

This whole episode did stir me to further work, and I ended up giving fetch-mock a tooling overhaul to \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/pull/429\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">follow babel best practice\u003C/a>, upgrade core-js and add \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/issues/446\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">support for ES modules\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because of the kind of tooling clashes I’ve outlined above, I felt it was unwise to release these changes as a minor, so I went through quite a rigorous process of creating a new major version, inviting comment from users on various alpha releases.

I've been a siginificant contributor to both a [library of components](http://registry.origami.ft.com/components) and the [specification governing them](http://origami.ft.com/docs/component-spec/), and am now working on a [project](http://financial-times.github.io/next/) that consumes these modules and a plethora of others in a microservice architecture. I have also tattooed 'npm' on one shoulder and 'bower' on the other, and am debating whether I should go for a vintage 'browserify' or the more contemporary 'webpack' on my nether regions.\n\nUnderpinning all this componentisation is semver, both the [specification](http://semver.org/) defining how these version numbers relate to a release's contents, and the [node module](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) that parses these version numbers. Between them they make it possible for an application to request versions of components compatible with a given range.\n\nTo recap, here's what the semver spec says:\n\n> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:\n* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,\n* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and\n* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.\n\nSo semver, used correctly, rigidly communicates to consumers (be they human or machine) how significant the code changes in a release are. Consumers can therefore make informed decisions about how to respond to the release. [Semver ranges](http://semver.org/) such as `~1.2.3`, `^2.3.4`, `>=2.9.7 \u003C 4` are the standard way for machine consumers to specify whether to accept a given new release or not. If you have faith in a publisher's use of semver it's fairly safe to use the semver range `^2.3.4` or similar in your dependency manifest as this literally means \n\n>Accept all releases which don't change the API in an incompatible way compared to version 2.3.4 \n\n(In the rest of this article I'll be assuming that `^2.3.4` is the type of semver range generally used by consumers of a component).\n\nBut there is a downside. When working with a large componentised architecture releasing a major version of a component can be a devil to roll out as each dependent will need to have its dependency manifest (package.json, bower.json etc.) updated. Any that are missed will languish with old versions of the component installed, leading to a range of problems e.g. \n - If a component is updated to stop fetching data from a deprecated service any applications which don't have the update installed will break when that service is switched off\n - It becomes confusing for developers when different major versions of a component are used in different places - 'How is this version different to that one?'\n - If an application really needs some feature only available in a more recent major version it's difficult to know if upgrading will be a big task or not\n\nOn a few occasions recently myself and colleagues have released breaking changes as minor releases. We've been doing so bashfully, referring to them as a 'cheeky ~~Nando's~~ minor', or apologising for them in our chatroom. But these abuses of semver have in fact had a positive impact on the release process - things get stuck on the last major version less often, increasing the uptake of the latest patches and new API features. So I've been trying to understand what distinguishes these benign semver misdemeanours from semver attrocities.\n\nFor me the key is to think of semver as a communication tool to tell consumers something about your component. Then the main factor which determines when it might be OK to abuse semver is how critical semver is to how you communicate with your consumers. \n\nIf your knowledge of the component's consumers is limited and semver is your only reliable way to communicate to *all* of them (this is typically the case for open source projects) then stick to the semver spec *to the letter*. It's irresponsible to break a convention when you have no reliable way of communicating that you're doing so. If you introduce a breaking change without releasing a major version you will have failed to warn your consumers, using the only channel open to you, that the release may end up breaking their application. \n\nIf, however, you have complimentary channels to communicate and manage software updates for *all* your consumers then it can be OK to be less strict. For example, if you're creating components for internal company use (albeit possibly using open source registries, such as npm, as a delivery mechanism) then it's probable you will have good information about who your consumers are and have additional channels to communicate with them. You may have some influence over their codebases and deployment processes too. It may even be the case that the only consumers are your team and the applications you've written. \n\nIn this case semver is complementary to other tools and practices used by you and your component's consumers. You may be able to release a breaking change as a minor or patch version provided:\n - You know about all the teams and codebases that consume your component and what service level you're expected to provide to them\n - You communicate well about the change to your consumers. You should have 100% confidence that information delivered via these other communication channels will get through\n - The risk of something breaking for the end user is negligable. As an additional consideration it's worth thinking abut whether the risks and costs of your breaking something are smaller than those caused by some consumers failing to update their code. \n\nAs an example of when we've done this, in [next-build-tools](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-build-tools) (a cli for building and deploying microservices and components for [next.ft.com](https://next.ft.com)) we wanted to add a subroutine to `nbt verify` to check for version parity between certain node modules and their bower equivalents, and fail the build if the condition was not met. Rather than making this sub-routine an opt-in, we decided it would be better to have every microservice's build run it by default, with the ability to opt out for those which didn't require the parity check. This would cause every API microservice's build to fail with:\n\n```\nError: `next-build-tools verify` now checks to see if your bower and npm component versions match. If you're building an app without a UI `next-build-tools verify --skip-layout-checks`\n```\n\nBut this breaking change would never affect the end user as our CI pipeline won't deploy given a failed build. The breakage was well-communicated via our dev chatroom and the informative error message so it was also easy for consumers to adapt.\n\nThe end result of this was that all applications for which it was relevant started carrying out the bower-npm parity check without requiring any code changes. Granted, a lot of other applications' builds had to be modified slightly, but in a very simple way and only when they were being rebuilt anyway, so the cost was low. No `package.json`s needed to be altered and all applications continued to receive all the latest new features and patches. I call this a win.\n\nIn a curious twist, the bigger the breaking change the safer it is to take this approach. If you're sure that your change will break any build of any codebase that is incompatible with the new API then the code won't get deployed to production. A smaller, more niche change e.g. removing a long ago deprecated method, though superficially less dangerous is more likely to slip through the net and cause bugs in production. But in these sorts of situations it can still be possible to release the change as a minor release *if* you work to make the risk of a break in production negligable e.g. search the codebase of each consumer to make sure all dependents will cope with the change.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still think respecting semver is the right approach most of the time - I'm not advocating releasing sweeping API changes as minor versions. But for changes which are technically breaking but carry low risk and are limited in scope a well-managed minor release can be both easier and less time consuming to roll out. From a code comprehensibility point of view it will also lead to a closer correlation between major releases and truly significant API changes - no more wondering if v14 is a complete departure from v13, or if it just removes a long-deprecated method.\n\nSemver is an indispensable tool, but if you're striving to have all your applications running the latest component code it can get in the way. If major semver versions are making it hard to upgrade your dependencies it might be worth bending the rules occasionally.","src/data/blog-posts/2015-09-27-semver-abuse.md","b4b523e2b11bb410",{"html":144,"metadata":145},"\u003Cp>It’s safe to say that I’m now very much used to working with components.

To a point, it makes code more comprehensible, indicating which statements should be thought of as a larger whole and also pointing about where the language's block-level features are being applied. But taken too far it can lead to a confusing mess; there's a reason it's called the pyramid of doom. In some cases even a couple of levels of indentation can be confusing (after scrolling down a screenfull of statements try remembering if that `}` closes a `for` loop or an `if`...)\n\nIndentation, as implied in the last sentence, is almost invariably accompanied by the presence of a curly brace, something all C-family languages have in common. A few years ago when I contemplated learning Ruby and Coffeescript I was ambivalent to their whitespace-sensitive, curly brace free worlds. 'It's more expressive, closer to natural language', screamed the advocates. 'Its like sentences if you can even call them that without proper punctuation', I garbled back from my `{` crenelated `}` codebase. \n\nBut something interesting has happened lately; javascript has belatedly begun to add new programming concepts and cross-pollinate with other languages, leading to code that looks very different.\n\nFirst up, Promises. The pyramid of doom, easily fallen into in callback-era code, is now easier to circumvent thanks to `.then()`\n\n```\nmyThing()\n\t.then(function (result) {\n        // do some sync stuff first then\n\t\treturn doAThingTo(result.value)\n\t})\n\t.then(function (result2) {\n        // do some sync stuff first then\n\t\treturn doAnotherThingTo(result2.value)\n\t});\n```\n\nThis is far neater than a lot of similar code written using callbacks. In the code sample above I've used the convention we've adopted (though not strictly enforced) at the FT of indenting `.then()` calls by a single tab, which makes for very readable code. I've also avoided nesting `then()` calls (e.g. I could have had the second then directly attached to the result of `doAThingTo(result)`), though sometimes the nature of the procedure demands some nesting e.g.\n\n```\nmyThing()\n\t.then(function (result) {\n\t\tif (result.ok) {\n\t\t\treturn result.contents()\n\t\t\t\t.then(function (contents) {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn contents.values\n\t\t\t\t})\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tthrow 'Not ok';\n\t\t}\n\t})\n```\n\nIt is _possible_ to write the above using flatter indentation, but often it's just easier to nest a little; the flatter your `.then()` tree the more you have to worry about ignoring or handling certain kinds of error in your calls to `.catch()`, so sometimes a bit of extra indentation is the lesser of two evils.\n\nSo far, so dull, but also fairly readable. Now let's introduce another ES6 feature to make it even better - arrow functions. The first example above becomes\n\n```\nmyThing()\n    .then(result => doAThingTo(result.value))\n    .then(result2 => doAnotherThingTo(result2.value));\n```\n\nThis is starting to look quite beautiful. So now for a slightly more complex example\n\n```\nthis.keys()\n    .then(keys =>\n        Promise.all(\n            keys\n                .map(key =>\n                    this.db.get(key.url)\n                        .then(({expires} = {}) => ({key, expires}))\n            )\n        )\n            .then(lookups =>\n                lookups\n                    .sort((i1, i2) => {\n                        return i1.expires > i2.expires ? -1 : i1.expires \u003C i2.expires ? 1 : 0;\n                    })\n                    .slice(count)\n                    .map(({key}) => this.delete(key))\n            )\n    )\n```\n\nWait... who did what in the where, now??\n\nFinally I'm getting to my point - all these ES6 goodies (and ES5 such as `.map()`) may help us slay the old readability dragons, but they've brought some dragon eggs with them, and it feels like they're just coming to the end of incubation. I've found myself reading code (written by others, or by myself in the recent past), which demonstrates confidence in the language, is concise as a word and elegant as a swan in an evening dress, but lacks many of the visual cues I'm used to seeing in javascript. The above example - excluding object literals - contains only _a single pair of curly braces_, but the logic it carries out is Teotihuacan in scale, and, even though I wrote it... I find it pretty confusing to look at.\n\nThere are simply no established practices regarding how we format and indent code written using new ES6 features, and, as a result, there's a danger our code will gradually become an incomprehensible mess. We have tools like eslint and lintspaces to enforce coding style on a more granular level, but these, I fear, lag behind the expressiveness of the modern language.\n\nSo our best hope here is to establish good conventions, and avoid code smells. Here are a few I think may be worth starting with, and the reasons why. They're not rules I rigorously adhere to yet - I'm having way too much fun with the new language features to let trivial things like ease of comprehension or maintainability bother me - but when this ES6 world gets too much, I will return here to read the words I TOLD YOU SO!\n\n## 1. There is no shame in being verbose\nNot a rule, but more a guiding principle. We're often led to believe that concise code is cleaner and better, but the less you write the harder it is to be explicit about your code's intention. If in doubt, press more keys!!\n\n## 2. Always indent `.then` calls on a new line\nAs mentioned a few paragraphs above, it makes for readable Promise chains\n\n## 3. Start a new line and indent any array methods where more than one is used in a chain\nAgain, this makes for more readable code. The reason I don't argue for _always_ starting a new line is that often the methods will be used to apply a very basic function - e.g. extracting a property from an object - and insisting on indenting can lead to more visually-fragmented code e.g. the following almost looks like it could be a mistake, and would be clearer written on one line\n```\nmyThing.getProp.getArrayPromise(arr => arr\n    .map(item => item.key)\n)\n```\n\n## 4. When applying array methods within a `Promise.all`, always indent the target array if using more than one array method\n\nThis more or less follows from the last point. I would rather look at\n```\nPromise.all(\n    myArray\n        .map(item => item.thing)\n        .filter(thing => {\n            if (thing > 1) {\n                return 'ham';\n            } else {\n                return 'egg';\n            }\n        })\n)\n```\nThan\n```\nPromise.all(myArray\n    .map(item => item.thing)\n    .filter(thing => {\n        if (thing > 1) {\n            return 'ham';\n        } else {\n            return 'egg';\n        }\n    }))\n```\nor \n```\nPromise.all(myArray.map(item => item.thing).filter(thing => {\n    if (thing > 1) {\n        return 'ham';\n    } else {\n        return 'egg';\n    }\n}))\n```\nIn ES6, parentheses often play a similar signposting role to curly braces; a lack of discipline in where they're applied should hurt our eyes as much as\n```\nif (thing)\n{\n    if(otherThing) callMe()\n    else {ignoreMe()}\n} else if (anotherThing) {\n    blahBlah()\n}else{whatever()\n}\n```\n\n## 5. Prefer to use curly braces and a `return` statement for complex _anonymous_ arrow functions\nIt's great to use e.g. `arr.map(entry => entry.name)`, but, as in the database lookup example above, it's possible to return far more complex results, such as `Promise.all` wrapped maps of maps of arrays. In addition to the lack of `return` statements making it confusing work out what - if anything - is being returned, the code is complex enough to develop bugs. It will therefore require stepping into or logging while debugging. The fewer explicit statements there are in your code, the harder it is to jump in exactly where you want, so your code may need a rewrite to become debuggable. These rewrites will involve putting new curly braces in exactly the right place within a series of nested parentheses. It's very easy to make mistakes, and it just isn't worth this much pain to save typing a `return ` and a `{` `}`. \n\n## 6. When within a `.then()` call, try returning Promises before calling `.then()` on them\nThis is very similar to stating 'Avoid nesting `.then()` calls', but offers a technique to help achieve this. It can be hard to spot when you're doing unnecessary nesting, but a good question to ask is 'Could the Promise I'm `then`-ing have been returned before I called `.then()` on it?' By asking this question just now I spotted an unecessary nesting in the database example above which I'd previously missed despite staring at the code for days.\n\ne.g.\n\n```\nquery()\n    .then(results => {\n        return Promise.all(results.map(getter))\n            .then(finalCalculation)\n    })\n```\ncould be rewritten as\n```\nquery()\n    .then(results => Promise.all(results.map(getter)))\n    .then(finalCalculation)\n```\n\n## 7. Declaring named functions matters as much as ever, \nArrow functions and chainable methods may make manipulating data inline more concise and less cluttered, but ease of authorship of the _parts_ of the program does not equate to clarity of the whole. As it's now far easier to make the magic happen inline, it perhaps requires a little more discipline to recognise when a program is complex enough to benefit from abstracting into discrete parts. And our code can only really be self-documenting if we take it apart and give the constituent parts good names.\n\nThe code below achieves the same result as the database example above (ignore the sloppy use of `this`). Its also roughly the same number of lines as before - abstracting away the complex chains into functions means the remaining wiring can be written clearly with far less need for additional indented lines.\n\n```\nconst decorateWithExpiry = key => {\n    return this.db.get(key.url)\n        .then(({expires} = {}) => ({key, expires}))\n}\n\nconst deleteOldest = lookups => {\n    return lookups\n        .sort((i1, i2) => {\n            return i1.expires > i2.expires ? -1 : i1.expires \u003C i2.expires ? 1 : 0;\n        })\n        .slice(count)\n        .map(({key}) => this.delete(key))\n}\n\nthis.keys()\n    .then(keys => Promise.all(keys.map(decorateWithExpiry)))\n    .then(deleteOldest)\n```\n\n- - -\n\nIs seven points enough? I reckon so.","src/data/blog-posts/2016-09-19-indenting-es6.md","d29e8bdcadda864d",{"html":180,"metadata":181},"\u003Ch1 id=\"indenting-es2015\">Indenting ES2015\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Indentation is something all coders have a love/hate relationship with.

Many of these are a consequence of the fact we have to support an ever growing number of environments with increasing, rather than decreasing, variance in their adoption of given APIs. Even though browser vendors now cooperate more fully than in the past when it comes to writing and implementing the standards, a large chunk of our audience still visit our sites using legacy browsers.\n\nAs well as restricting access to new APIs this slow and piecemeal upgrading of the web has another side effect - it's nigh-on impossible for the specs to make breaking changes, therefore bad engineering/design decisions stick around for a long time. \n\nI was recently in a workshop with [Harry Roberts](http://csswizadry.com). Most of the contents of the workshop were about how to avoid getting into specicifity wars in CSS. As an aside he mentioned that specicifity is arguably a bad feature of CSS that should never have been put in in the first place. \n\nThe more I think about it, the more I agree with this. If you adopt the good practice of writing your styles in a cascading fashion, starting with generic ones and gradually adding those for narrower use cases then specicifity is not needed and can often be a hinderance. With the exception of `!important` specicifity could be done away with altogether (inline styles, as the last styles in the cascade applied to an element wouldn't need any special specicifity either).\n\nBut how to get rid of specicifity? The web is built on HTML, CSS and javascript, and it's hard to envision any of them disappearing soon. But due to the inherent non-upgradability of the web we can't have some browsers suddenly ditching specicifty as it would likely break a lot of sites and place a heavy burden on developers to upgrade their stylesheets to not rely on specicifity.\n\nAn alternative might be to define a new standard styling language which can be included alongside CSS stylesheets - specicifity isn't the only gripe people have with CSS and it might be worth starting from scratch on a new, improved standard, which newer browsers would favour over CSS if stylesheets using both standards are provided.\n\nBut again, this would place a heavy burden on developers to maintain two differet types of stylesheet, and to learn the differences between the two standards (onerous whether it's learning a totally new syntax or memorising the subtle differences between the two). It also places high expectations on browser vendors to back, implement and maintain a new standard.\n\nI think what the web needs is a new attribute on the `\u003Clink>` tag:\n\n```html\n\u003Clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"main.css\" specicifity=\"false\" />\n```\n\nwhich developers can use to turn off specicifity in browsers that support doing so. Stylesheets written using a well structured cascade from general to narrower use cases *should* still work fine without any change. They will likely already contain a few extra-specific style rules in order to cope with specicifity problems in existing browsers, but as long as these specicifity overrides are included in a sensible order then removing specicifity shouldn't lead to them getting overridden by other styles. And testing to see whether your styles work with specicifity on or off is trivial - just add or remove the `specicifity=\"false\"` attribute. Any styles that need to preserve specicifity (for instance to override third party styles) could have it re-enabled using, for instance a css property `specific: true`.\n\nAs well as getting rid of what is probably the hardest problem while writing scaleable CSS, removing specicifity would likely improve rendering times slightly as it's one less thing for browsers to have to process. It's probably also not particularly difficult for browsers to implement (I'd be surprised if it doesn't boil down to skipping over a step or two when parsing and rendering).\n\nSo, who's with me?","src/data/blog-posts/2014-03-02-a-very-specific-problem.md","9d56d61f6ff66fb5",{"html":222,"metadata":223},"\u003Cp>There are many things that are ‘the’ bane of a front-end developer’s life.

In the mobile age, where performance is increasingly given equal footing with design, functionality and content, this additional cost prior to page rendering should be avoided if at all possible.\n\nBut given that the html specs are now a working, evolving document constantly being added to, and that browsers will implement any new features whenever they like (even before they're added to the spec) the problem of feature detection is not going to go away, and it's not going to become less important. So if the problem is here to stay and the solution is suboptimal, what do we do? \n\nThe answer's obvious if we start from the principle that solving a universal, persistent problem on the web shouldn't, long term, be the responsibility of a utility library; it should be resolved by the specs and browsers themselves.\n\nSo I suggest browsers implement a `window.features` object which, more or less, duplicates the `Modernizr` object i.e. for a given feature `window.features.theFeature` is a boolean denoting whether or not the browser supports it (in reality, it would likely either be `true` or `undefined`). Then Modernizr would become a polyfill for `window.features`. Modernizr's [lack of a] naming convention for features would need to be looked at, but that's a minor niggle. \n\nAs well as the javascript API Modernizr does of course offer the convenience of adding css classes to enable feature detection within stylesheets. This is fine, but with native feature detection support the browser could do much better and give us access to a new category of media query `@media (feature: svg) {}`. Adding a feature to `window.features` would have the side effect of making the media query for that feature truthy.\n\nPolyfilling this with Modernizr would be less straightforward than the javascript implementation, likely relying on continuing to add classes to the html and duplicating style blocks:\n\n```css\n@media (feature: svg) {\n  /* styles */\n}\n.svg {\n  /* styles */\n}\n```\n\n… though with css preprocessors and gzipping this isn't necessarily onerous to write or hugely detrimental to file size.\n\nTo sum up, what I want is a day when I only have to run a single feature test in my code\n\n```javascript\nif (!window.features) {\n   // download Modernizr\n}\n```\n\nNow, wouldn't that be nice.","src/data/blog-posts/2014-04-07-beyond-modernizr.md","4238bcab8b0e79d2",{"html":240,"metadata":241},"\u003Cp>Few javascript libraries have achieved the ubiquity of Modernizr.

Eventually I hope this will turn into a new career in tech policy, hence the reanimation of this blog as a place to demonstrate that there's at least some substance to my claims to be a cross-disciplinarian of some potential use.\n\nToday I'm taking a brief detour from dissertation writer's block to share some thoughts on the government's recent report on their [Microsoft 365\nCopilot Experiment](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/683db42bd23a62e5d32680d0/M365_Copilot_Experiment_Findings_Report.pdf), with the [press release](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-government-trial-shows-ai-could-save-civil-servants-nearly-2-weeks-a-year) claiming \"Landmark government trial shows AI could save civil servants nearly 2 weeks a year\". But does the research provide sound evidence to back that claim?\n\nTo address the elephant in the room, yes there is a lot of AI hype about, and yes there are a lot of people high up in government, the tech industry, and probably academia too, who desperately want AI to be a success. So I approached reading the report with a supposition that the \"2 weeks a year\" claim would be absolutely the most positive spin that could possible be made of the results. Even before reviewing the research paper my initial reaction was that it's an underwhelming figure. Steam power meant cloth could be manufactured with a quarter of the workforce. Computers allowed entire offices full of people whose former job title was \"computer\" to be let go. Considering the hype about AI being a general purpose transformative technology, productivity gains of ~4% are hardly breathtaking. Does this represent a good return on investment, for the government's outlay on copilot licences? And would other approaches, such as investing in training, delier the results just as effectively?\n\nNow, on to review the actual research. The objectives are defined as follows:\n\n> \"The objective of this experiment was to understand the value that an AI tool such as\n\tM365 Copilot would bring when deployed across a large portion of the UK\n\tgovernment. Value was defined as improvements in efficiency, task completion\n\trates, and overall user satisfaction.\"\n\nSeems pretty sensible. Having said that, outside of this statement \"task completion\" is not mentioned again, and it appears that nothing in the research methodology actually set out to gather data to answer this question. But it's a minor quibble. Come to think of it, some graphs are mislabelled too. Sloppiness like this is probably a sign that it's not been thoroughly peer-reviewed.\n\nA far bigger quibble is that being an adopter of Copilot is defined as somebody with \"at least one interaction with M365 Copilot in the previous 30 days.\" Given that the research only ran for 3 months, this means that using Copilot just 3 times would put a civil servant in the \"adopters\" cohort. And what counts as an interaction? So the claim that the adoption rate was 80% overall is rather dubious. At a cursory glance it doesn't actually impact the validity of the rest of the data and findings (though more on the flaws in that below), but does serve to unnecessarily exaggerate how impactful the software was organisationally: it suggests that 80% of people were saving the equivalent of 2 weeks per year, as opposed to a much lower figure that is not inferrable from the report. \n\nMost of the study's data came from surveys rather than actual usage data. There doesn't appear to be any real effort to correlate surveys with data about actual usage of Copilot, which seems strange to me: it should be possible to arrange that for at least some users as a way of checking how accurate self-reported estimates of Copilot usage were. There's no access to the actual survey questions, but users appear to have been asked how often they use copilot in a variety of applications: daily or weekly. A noteworthy trend here is that \"Daily usage was centred around using M365 Copilot for communications, compared to more infrequent weekly use for content creation.\" \n\nNow on to the part of the report reproduced in big red letters in the press release: time savings. This is where the boldest claims are made, but, I would argue, the methodology is deeply flawed. Users appear to have been asked to estimate what their daily time savings using copilot are. There are a couple of big issues here.\n\nFirstly, estimating time saved is going to be very subjective and unreliable. Even if each user is self-consistent in their biased recollections, without any effort to correlate these estimates with real measurements of efficiency it really is an exercise in collective finger waving. The press relase should really read, \"Landmark government trial shows civil servants __reckon__ AI could save them nearly 2 weeks a year\".\n\nSecondly, as we just saw, usage of Copilot in many tools is approximately weekly. Asking users to estimate how much time they save daily, when combining subjective assessments of some things they use daily and others weekly is unlikely to be accurate. They were asked a second question, estimating the amound of time saved daily in each application when using Copilot. The figures are presented as graphs, not as a data table, but I would be surprised if the product of adoption and time saved data per tool results in a similar estimate to the overall one\u003Csup>1\u003C/sup>. Given the general unreliable nature of self-reported estimates, and the fact the project involved 14,000 staff, running a proper controlled trial that looked at actual usage data seems like it would have yielded far more reliable, unsubjective data.\n\nAt last, though, it's time to draw attention to something quite good, actually, about the trial. The user satisfaction ratings are pretty positive, both in terms of quantifiable answers to questions like \"Copilot saves me time on mundane tasks\" and the more freeform feedback. Judging from what some former colleagues have told me about efforts to encourage AI use in their workplaces, such positive user experiences are far from a given. \n\nOn the flipside, this is not the only story told by the qualitative feedback.

I rarely have *that* good an answer, but recently I realised there is a pattern to how I gained a lot of the technical knowledge I do have — I’ve taken part in a *lot* of migration projects.\n\nSo the TLDR; from this article for anyone seeking to turbocharge their technical knowledge is:\n\nIf there’s a big, complex, scary, maybe boring-sounding migration coming up, volunteer for it. It’s not glamorous, eye-catching work, but you will learn a lot from the experience.\n\nTo illustrate what I mean, here’s my history of doing migrations in 4 chapters. Having read it a few times to check for typos, I’m struck (even more than I expected to be) by how closely it mirrors the kind of skills you have to acquire as you progress from engineer, to senior to and then to principal.\n\n## 1. MyFT\n\nMyFT is now one of the most successful features of FT.com. It started off as an experiment back in the bootcamp days of the website rebuild. After a few months, those leading the project saw that it had potential, and myself and [Arjun](https://twitter.com/adgad) formed a small team to refine it.\n\nA few weeks in, we realised that the data model we had, stored in the somewhat inflexible DynamoDB, did not fit well with where we wanted to take it, so we decided we had to move all the data into a different structure. I can’t remember exactly how we broke down the work, but I ended up writing the migration script.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*xs03u-MfOTGLPtqE)\n\nA migration script, for the uninitiated, is an often ugly — it’s only going to be used once — piece of code that will read all the data from one store and write it to another, carrying out any transformations necessary. The sensible way to run such a script is to migrate from a test database to a test database, then from the old one to a test one, and then from the old one to the new one — making sure that you have backups and a rollback plan. Being a novice, I did none of these things. We turned off the application, ran the script and — luckily — it all still worked (though we may have needed to give it a few nudges).\n\nNot so long after, we decided to remodel the data again, and migrated to yet another data store — neo4j graph database — and this time the task didn’t seem so frightening. I had some code snippets I could reuse from the previous migration, and I’d learned what parts of the previous migration — the lack of a backout plan for instance — were stressful, so I was able to mitigate them by planning more carefully. As I recall, it went without a hitch, with only a little planned downtime.\n\nThere was a sting in the tail a few months on when we discovered that all the indexes on the new database had gone missing. Recovering from that wasn’t fun (a rare occasion when I’ve worked really late), but the skills I’d learned from the first two migrations meant I could deal with it relatively calmly and analytically.\n\nSo that’s the first thing I got from migrations — I lost my fear of databases and, more generally, fear of technologies I don’t consider myself an expert in. I’m still not a DB expert, but I’ve gained a lot of common sense knowledge of how to work with them.\n\n## 2. n-ui\n\n[n-ui](https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-ui) was the front end templating, asset loading and web page bootstrapping behemoth shared by all ft.com’s user facing microservices. While I still have fond memories of working on it, and some residual pride in what it was capable of, it’s fair to say that it was a monster that was difficult to understand and [hard to work with](https://speakerdeck.com/wheresrhys/speeding-up-without-slowing-down-1?slide=36). This was still true at version 7, but nothing compared to the horrors it contained at versions 1 & 2.\n\nAfter hearing the generally negative reviews from the engineering team, I worked on rolling back some of its worst unintuitive excesses in a sandboxed environment. But by the time the new, slightly simplified version 3 was ready to be adopted, n-ui was deeply embedded in around 15 applications. Upgrading every one of them would be a mammoth task; I was going to need some help.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2458/0*s5xPcnyhhT0mH6Dh)\n\nSo I booked a large meeting room, invited 10 engineers or so, bought a range of biscuits from our local supermarket, and we all sat down to code. I’d done some preparation, writing a step by step guide to what would need changing in a typical application, but very soon voices piped up stating that things weren’t working as predicted (the ft.com frontend is built out of a lot of front end components, and [updating the cascade](https://origami.ft.com/blog/2019/10/31/major-cascade/) can be full of surprises).\n\nBy the end of the day a respectable number of applications had pull requests ready to merge, and for all the others we had a good understanding of how to overcome the obstacles we’d uncovered. Everyone had enjoyed the experience too; there was a real hack-day vibe in that room, and the sense of achievement at being tantalisingly close to getting rid of some coding patterns that everybody despised was immense.\n\nThis was also the first time I’d set up a technical project by myself and arranged for a number of people to work towards a moderately time-pressured goal. I learned a lot about how to coordinate people to work as a team, and how to help the team adapt to unexpected events. This would serve me well as I approached the next migration, which was just around the corner.\n\n## 3. CAPI2\n\nThe [Financial Times Content API](https://developer.ft.com/portal/services) (or CAPI for short) has had two major versions — CAPI1 and CAPI2. In an ideal world, CAPI2 would have provided everything we needed to build ft.com before the project began, but it was not to be, so we built it mainly on top of CAPI1.\n\nAs CAPI2’s content model gained feature parity with CAPI1 (i.e. it could represent all the elements of a typical story written in the newsroom), we were ready to move off CAPI1, but for one snag: CAPI2 had a completely different metadata system to CAPI1. They both annotated articles with pieces of metadata, but between CAPI1 and CAPI2 the ids were different, the content of each item of metadata was different, and the relationships between the content and the metadata were described differently. The APIs that allowed interacting with this metadata also differed in subtle but annoying ways.\n\nThis CAPI1 metadata was being used all over the place, from urls for index pages to allowing users to follow topics they were interested in in myFT. Migrating to CAPI2 without breaking any of the features that relied on CAPI1 was a huge undertaking. As my boss [Sarah](https://twitter.com/sarahjwells) is fond of saying, we had to [change horses midstream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H06qrNmGqyE). There was also a lot of time pressure, as decommissioning the complex and expensive to run CAPI1 infrastructure was blocked by ft.com’s usage of it, and this risked derailing other aspects of the decom project.\n\nI won’t go through the details (there are too many to remember), but the skills I’d learned from previous migrations were invaluable. I had to reason about the impact and dependencies of a wide range of changes (including having plans to rollback any that failed), coordinate the work of various teams, and still get stuck in with practical engineering work, focusing my effort on the parts of the project that seemed most at risk of falling behind. I had to communicate regularly with stakeholders and people in other teams who were working on other early stages of the CAPI1 switch off, making sure I was clear and open about what was on track and what wasn’t. When things weren’t working out as planned, or achieving the ideal solution was too much effort, I had to make the call to go for Plan B, and this often meant negotiating with other teams to get them on board with the new approach.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2838/0*L-nFS8t6EwiE-OM6)\n\nWhat I’ve just described is my learning to be a technical leader. I might have waited a long time for another opportunity to get that experience if the CAPI1 migration hadn’t come along when it did. When we hit the final switch to turn off our API calls to CAPI1, we all gathered around my laptop and listened to the[ theme to Chariots of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSav51fVlKU), which felt like an appropriate way to end it.\n\n## 4. Dewey\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*I-AuhoRg0Hma60ET)\n\nAnd on to my present job, in the Reliability Engineering team. One of the things we do is try to build up a picture of all the tech we run and how it relates to the business’s activities. Over the years there have been several attempts to model this information. The most recent but one was called Dewey, a Postgres database with a number of user interfaces and consumers hanging off it, with varying degrees of coupling.\n\nWhen I arrived, the migration to its successor — Biz Ops — was already at the advanced prototype stage as far as the data model was concerned, but had barely begun when it came to working out how to replace the Dewey APIs, admin screens, update streams and a number of applications that depended on them. The ambitious goal was to migrate with zero downtime.\n\nSuperficially, the migration was less challenging than CAPI1 — lower stakes, and without much time pressure — but what made it more difficult was that this was a source of data that we both wrote to and read from, and maintaining its consistency was entirely our responsibility. Its users were also internal, and we had the reputation of our fledgling team to think of; we didn’t want to start off with a car crash project that degraded other teams’ ability to do their jobs.\n\nThis was the first time I’d been responsible for a migration that wasn’t some hidden technical detail. This time, we expected people to notice the change, and hopefully to like it. As a team that only has technical staff, I had to product and project manage. This meant attempting to understand our users enough to make the right decisions about which disruptions would be acceptable. To this day I’m not convinced that the migration process was the most sensible — continuously syncing updates from the old to the new datastore, and gradually killing off edit functionality in the old applications — but it did give us the ability to get early feedback before the new applications were complete (a practice I highly recommend). While there were some trying episodes where the new product wasn’t meeting users’ expectations, it’s far better to address these when things are still fluid, rather than when the project is supposed to be finished.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*1UHsAnuCR6FOf5i5)\n\nThe migration, to the untrained eye, ended with one last script to fix some inaccurately mapped cost attribution data, and then my colleague [Laura](https://twitter.com/lc512k)’s [son clicked the merge button on the final PR](https://twitter.com/stuffeitansays/status/1058479830587633665). What followed for our team was a tedious decommissioning job, and, soon after, migrating the new stack in its entirety into a dedicated AWS account (difficult while it was still hooked up to updates from the old applications).\n\nA year on from the switch over day, we have a product that is still growing in use, and a team that has a reputation for [building useful, high quality tools for our users.](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/s-o-s-a-game-for-engineers-5a22af6dfb21)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n> migrating the new stack in its entirety into a dedicated AWS account\n\nI would never have imagined, just a few years ago, that I’d be saying that so nonchalantly. It’s largely working on migrations over the years that has given me the technical, planning, communication and leadership skills that mean I see complex technical projects as challenges, but not as insurmountable mountains to climb.\n\nBut what are the main things I’ve learned from throwing myself into migration projects\n\n### A greater awareness of the full software lifecycle\n\nWhen implementing a new feature everyone is in a forward thinking mindset — how do we get X to work, how do we add this widget, etc., and it’s rare, in a mature DevOps project, that changes cannot be undone by clicking a button or reverting a PR. But backing out of something that is deeply embedded in your tech requires a lot more thought and planning. Once learned on a migration project, these aptitudes can be used again and again. They are particularly useful when evaluating the pros of cons when you introduce libraries, dependencies etc. into projects.\n\n### How to work with difficult, legacy codebases\n\nLegacy projects are never the nicest thing to work on, but it’s an unfortunate fact that, given enough time, every application becomes something that people are afraid to touch. Migration is a great way to get comfortable working in codebases you don’t know and don’t fully understand, gleaning just enough knowledge to get you through, and ending with a positive achievement; you will have decommissioned at least some of the horrible codebase you were stuck working in.\n\n### Directing other people’s work\n\nWithout becoming a full on, permanent tech lead, migrations can give you an opportunity to shepherd people from across different teams and disciplines in pursuit of a shared goal. You will gain the negotiation skills needed to get your boring migration prioritised above more exciting projects, and gain confidence in the validity of your views as — yes — a technical leader.\n\n… and lots more besides.\n\nSo give it a go — let boring, under the radar, thankless migrations be your route to becoming a better engineer. We’re always looking for talent so please have a look at our [Product and Technology microsite](https://roles.ft.com/) for more information about our teams.\n\n(Also check out my colleague Maggie's [great post about her recent migration story](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/achievement-unlocked-6edbc0b44ddd), replacing n-ui with something much, much better)","src/data/blog-posts/2020-03-27-migrating-up-the-tech-ladder.md","1c71de9e6e6252f6",{"html":276,"metadata":277},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*8oH9Gjuc9jzmDh20.jpg\" alt=\"Migrating birds\">\u003Cem>Migrating birds\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Every now and then I’ll be leading a team of engineers, and someone will ask something along the lines of “How did you learn how to do that?”.

This is the tumultuous story of its birth.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*ZgGlMrltCCQ_vljK)\n\nCaption: Screenshots of a RUNBOOK.md file, the graph of data it generates, and the finished static runbook.\n\n## **What is a runbook?**\n\nA runbook is a very specific type of technical documentation. With as few distractions as possible, it should tell somebody who is on call what they can do to restore (or at least improve) a service that’s not in a healthy state, and details of how to escalate if they are unable to fix the problem.\n\nSystems *will* break, given enough time, so documenting how to recover when that happens is a vital part of achieving our reliability goals. In early 2019 many runbooks were either incomplete or out of date, so a big focus for the FT’s Reliability Engineering team was to improve this situation.\n\nI’ll take you through some of the key points of the project, sharing what we did and what we learned along the way.\n\n## **1. Structured, interconnected data makes for a good runbook**\n\nWhen we spoke to our Operations Support team — who watch over our tech 24/7 — about which information should be in a good runbook, it tended to fall into 3 categories:\n\n1. Relationships between things, e.g. which systems depend on which others & which team is responsible for supporting a system\n\n1. Simple multiple choice or boolean properties indicating things such as whether a system contains personal data, or whether it has an automated rollback process\n\n1. Longer free text fields containing specific troubleshooting information and additional detail about types 1 and 2\n\nStoring runbook data in a format that captured this structure formed the basis of our [SOS project to gamify runbook quality](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/s-o-s-a-game-for-engineers-5a22af6dfb21). Our choice of data store for runbook information — a graph database called neo4j with a GraphQL API on top of it — is flexible enough to store and expose these types of data, and our runbooks are hosted on a very reliable static site made up of HTML snapshots taken whenever the data changes.\n\nThe systems that store, edit and display this information we collectively call ‘Biz Ops’, short for ‘Business Operations’.\n\n## **2. ‘Documentation as code’ has many advantages over other authoring workflows**\n\nBiz Ops has a CMS for administering the graph of data, as well as for editing the longer form technical and troubleshooting documentation. To edit a runbook, an engineer had to go to this CMS and edit the appropriate record.\n\nThere were several problems with this:\n\n* Editing large documents in text areas on a website is a poor authoring experience compared to, say, Google docs or your favourite desktop text editor.\n\n* It’s also detached from the process of making code changes; when a pull request that fundamentally changes the architecture of an application is made, we rely on the engineer to remember to head off to the Biz Ops website to update information there.\n\n* There’s no process or tooling to intervene and review the quality of documentation at the time of writing, or to go back and review changes at a later date.\n\nThese factors combined to leave our runbooks full of superficial, poorly structured and out of date information.\n\nProviding the ability to author runbooks in the same repository that held a system’s source code, and coupling runbook changes to code changes, seemed like an attractive solution to all these issues, and so we kicked off a project to support this workflow.\n\n## 3. Not everybody will tolerate YAML\n\nWe went through quite an extensive user research phase. This included circulating a draft proposal involving [lots of YAML and a directory of markdown files](https://gist.github.com/wheresrhys/5a83e95f6b55ee3fb2707b6833053300). This solicited plenty of useful feedback and — more importantly — got engineers across the department engaged with the project. We followed up with a workshop to discuss requirements and brainstorm ideas for improving on the first draft.\n\nThe resulting debate uncovered some inconvenient truths (to my dismay, not everybody is a fan of YAML) but was useful for identifying areas of agreement, as well as where we would need to continue working to find consensus. It really got people thinking about what goes into a *good *runbook too — many engineers had only ever experienced bad ones.\n\nSubsequently, a survey sent around the department helped reinforce the main conclusions from the meeting; that engineers were comfortable with us releasing a strongly opinionated solution as long as it required very little effort to integrate with, and that a single markdown file was the preferred format — RUNBOOK.md was born!\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*3z7K1z5v2dyvY7g9)\n\nCaption: Our survey showed a clear preference for a prescriptive approach (1 in this graph means “Just tell me the standard format and file structure, and I’m happy to stick to it”)\n\nThe proposal we circulated soon after — basically markdown with YAML front-matter — met with general approval so we were ready to start building the tool.\n\n## 4. Who needs YAML when markdown already is a structured data format?\n\nOur team is staffed partly by secondees, who join us for periods of 3 months from other departments. [Chee Rabbits](https://twitter.com/snootgirl) joined our team and took on the challenge of turning the RUNBOOK.md format into reality. In doing so, they injected a load of fresh ideas into our thinking.\n\nAfter conducting further [research into the pros and cons of variants on the proposed standard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQNPvOwYVzwfYXEmZtmWLQES5_o-xxHyieOOqG6cMa2GuadiksCRy9ZgF-GGujL6G7TQCcX9wDP6yIp/pub) (including how the files would display in the github UI), and investigating open source tools for [converting markdown into other structured data](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast), we decided to go for a format where H1 and H2 elements in the markdown file, and the content immediately after them, are coerced into properties of a JSON object. This has the advantage that the format is semantically structured and readable as a standalone file *or* as data to be piped into Biz Ops and our runbooks static site.\n\nOur tool for converting markdown to JSON, based on some yaml schema definitions, is now [open sourced](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@financial-times/tc-markdown-parser).\n\n## 5. User research is vital, but don’t forget to use all your available data\n\nWe collaborated with the FT.com team for [docs day](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/documentation-day-how-the-ft-com-team-improved-our-documentation-to-95-usefulness-in-7-hours-b73d1a7e6f30), which involved the whole engineering team taking a day to improve their runbooks using our new RUNBOOK.md tool. In many ways it was a success but for us, the maintainers of the tool, it was a mixed blessing.\n\nSome use cases we had thought would be quite rare turned out to be quite common. Several of the projects that were worked on that day had more than one system’s source code in a single repository and for the FT App — an enormous legacy codebase — the level of automation we’d assumed could trigger our runbook publishing didn’t quite exist.\n\nWhile the user research we did was clearly valuable, and steered us away from versions of the project that would have flopped, we had unfortunately only looked at half the picture.\n\nWe had access to lots of data, in the form of thousands of git repositories and system records in Biz Ops, that would have helped us answer questions like ‘What percentage of repositories hold code for multiple systems?’.\n\nBut we didn’t even get as far as *asking* the questions that the data would have helped answer. Armed with the user research, we thought we had the right answers, but with any answers come unspoken assumptions; we would have done well to spend some time examining those early on.\n\n## 6. Don’t just focus on what’s bad with the status quo: try to recognise what’s good too\n\nEven for repositories that fitted the ‘single system per repo, hooked up to continuous deployment’ paradigm, there were various teething problems and unforeseen downsides to the authoring experience. For instance, in the Biz Ops CMS there is autocomplete for creating dependency relationships between systems. This is not supported in whatever text editor the RUNBOOK.md author uses. Also, our new format did not support deleting all connections to other records, and locked the data it had written so this could not be corrected in the CMS either.\n\nNow that we recognise these disadvantages of RUNBOOK.md it’s possible to mitigate or eliminate them, but it’s always harder to retrofit things like this. A bit more analysis of what our existing solution was actually capable of and good at would have helped us address these cases earlier.\n\n## 7. Serverless applications and Github Apps are hard to test and debug\n\nThe application which controls the validation, parsing and ingestion of data from RUNBOOK.md files into Biz Ops is a suite of AWS lambda functions that listens to events published by our change log application and webhooks sent by Github.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*SYx--09fqZ4OAax6)\n\nIt’s a fairly convoluted system, listening to signals and drawing data from a number of different sources. Our initial user research suggested that we only needed to support listening to Change API events, and that building a Github App to validate runbooks and leave comments on Pull Requests was nice to have, but hardly an essential part of the project.\n\nHowever, if we’d done more digging into the data about deployment patterns we’d have realised that the Github app was, rather, an indispensable part of the project. We ended up having two parallel ingestion processes, with miniscule variations in behaviour and — you guessed it — bugs aplenty.\n\nEventually [Dora](https://twitter.com/doramilitaru) was able to rearchitect in the way it probably should have been from day one (had we only looked at the data… I can’t stress this enough — look at the data *before* you build). The final architecture has parsing handled by the github app, and the ingestion triggers (webhooks and change logs) are relatively thin layers on top of this. But even now that the architecture is more sensible, it’s still tricky to debug and release with confidence. I think we all learned the importance of having a good local mock when building for event sources outside of your application’s control.\n\n## 8. Always remember the problems you’re trying to solve\n\nOne of the problems — and arguably the most important — that this project was trying to solve was the tendency of runbooks to not get updated to keep up with the application’s code. We have plans to have more automation around code changes so that, e.g. on every pull request we automatically comment with a runbook maintenance checklist. But was there anything stopping us doing that first, before implementing the new authoring process?\n\nIt’s hard to say if such a nudging tool would be effective without a better authoring experience, but it would certainly have been quicker to implement.\n\n## So what’s next?\n\nThe project clearly isn’t over. There is so much more to delivering an internal product than building it. Now we’ve done the difficult engineering part — and it *was* difficult — we’re going to have to get on with the *even more difficult* cultural part. We’re collecting more metrics on what changes get made to runbooks and how, and will try different approaches to improve the numbers.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*XFUSyMMG8mw8sP6O)\n\nComplimenting what we’ve built so far, these might include new github apps, and slack integrations to nudge engineers towards updating more often, workshops and training to focus on more qualitative aspects of writing documentation, or maybe automating production of docs.\n\nWhatever the project looks like, it’s been a great learning process so far — both on the engineering and product delivery sides. We’ll be measuring the results we care about, validating approaches with as little effort as possible, and making sure that we get even more value out of the efforts of our talented engineering team.","src/data/blog-posts/2020-04-30-runbook-doctors.md","a1a1a5d99821cb38",{"html":319,"metadata":320},"\u003Cp>During 2019 we introduced a new runbook authoring standard at the FT, called RUNBOOK.md.

A bit more analysis of what our existing solution was actually capable of and good at would have helped us address these cases earlier.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"7-serverless-applications-and-github-apps-are-hard-to-test-and-debug\">7. Serverless applications and Github Apps are hard to test and debug\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The application which controls the validation, parsing and ingestion of data from RUNBOOK.md files into Biz Ops is a suite of AWS lambda functions that listens to events published by our change log application and webhooks sent by Github.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*SYx--09fqZ4OAax6\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s a fairly convoluted system, listening to signals and drawing data from a number of different sources. Our initial user research suggested that we only needed to support listening to Change API events, and that building a Github App to validate runbooks and leave comments on Pull Requests was nice to have, but hardly an essential part of the project.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, if we’d done more digging into the data about deployment patterns we’d have realised that the Github app was, rather, an indispensable part of the project. We ended up having two parallel ingestion processes, with miniscule variations in behaviour and — you guessed it — bugs aplenty.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eventually \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/doramilitaru\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dora\u003C/a> was able to rearchitect in the way it probably should have been from day one (had we only looked at the data… I can’t stress this enough — look at the data \u003Cem>before\u003C/em> you build). The final architecture has parsing handled by the github app, and the ingestion triggers (webhooks and change logs) are relatively thin layers on top of this. But even now that the architecture is more sensible, it’s still tricky to debug and release with confidence. I think we all learned the importance of having a good local mock when building for event sources outside of your application’s control.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"8-always-remember-the-problems-youre-trying-to-solve\">8. Always remember the problems you’re trying to solve\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>One of the problems — and arguably the most important — that this project was trying to solve was the tendency of runbooks to not get updated to keep up with the application’s code. We have plans to have more automation around code changes so that, e.g. on every pull request we automatically comment with a runbook maintenance checklist. But was there anything stopping us doing that first, before implementing the new authoring process?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s hard to say if such a nudging tool would be effective without a better authoring experience, but it would certainly have been quicker to implement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"so-whats-next\">So what’s next?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The project clearly isn’t over. There is so much more to delivering an internal product than building it. Now we’ve done the difficult engineering part — and it \u003Cem>was\u003C/em> difficult — we’re going to have to get on with the \u003Cem>even more difficult\u003C/em> cultural part. We’re collecting more metrics on what changes get made to runbooks and how, and will try different approaches to improve the numbers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*XFUSyMMG8mw8sP6O\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Complimenting what we’ve built so far, these might include new github apps, and slack integrations to nudge engineers towards updating more often, workshops and training to focus on more qualitative aspects of writing documentation, or maybe automating production of docs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Whatever the project looks like, it’s been a great learning process so far — both on the engineering and product delivery sides.

These man-made drinking water lagoons are important characters in their own right, and this blog wouldn't be complete without introducing you to them. Unless I have three or more hours to spare I don't have time to visit each one, so must choose. The choice is a reflection of both my mood and theirs. Sometimes I will leave the flat with one in mind, and on other days I'll see how I feel when I arrive.\n\nToday was always going to be a Lockwood day.\n\n![image](/assets/img/lockwood.jpg)\n\nLockwood Reservoir is the colossus of the Walthamstow Wetlands reserve. Three quarters of a mile end to end, a quarter of a mile wide and with imposing grass-covered concrete embankments lifting it several meters above its siblings, it's the white whale of my little corner of the Lee Valley. \n\nBe it a hot summer's day or a blustery winter morning, it takes commitment to traipse around its circumference. A fruitless hour spent shielding one's eyes from the sun's glare with nothing more to show for it than a few gulls and some angry coots is the epitome of the mid-summer birdwatching doldrums. And yet today, that's where the mood, in no uncertain terms, took me. Maybe it's guilt at having neglected to visit it lately, but more likely the birdwatcher's unquenchable thirst for finding something interesting in the spot where no-one else is looking.\n\nClimbing the gravel track up to the permit-holders path this walk had all the hallmarks of a disappointing haul. The air was still and very few birds made a sound. The swifts that are often to be seen wheeling overhead were absent too.\n\nI heard a Whitethroat &mdash; a summer migrant with a gravelly voice and an air of always having been intruded upon &mdash; burst briefly into song, but before I could 'record it for the blog' it had slipped into shouting a series of nasal alarm calls. A dunnock, one of our resident scratchy songsters, piped up and I marvelled at how both songs could be described as 'scratchy and tuneless', and yet sound nothing like one another. Mind you, all Irish music sounded the same to me until I learned to play, so it's all about training the ear.\n\nArriving at the circumnavigating service track I was delighted to see the path lined with a bank of purple flowers. Amazing what a week of sunshine can deliver. A little way down the path a fisherman sat amid the blooms, looking dazed and shell-shocked from the day's heat.\n\nA coot, probably my least favourite bird (more on that when it has its five minutes in the limelight), paddled busily in the shallows, showing off its extraordinary feet through the crystal clear water. I almost forgot how much contempt I hold them in, but still hoped to avoid descending to writing about them as early as day two of the blog.\n\nAnd then it arrived, the second boring bird of the summer - a **Peregrine Falcon**.\n\nIt really isn't in the spirit of this project to begin with not one but _two_ birds of prey. Birds of prey are the epitome of an un-boring bird. Even the relatively common buzzard or kestrel draw gasps of awe from time-worn birdwatchers, and the peregrine is an especially legendary specimen.\n\n[Yesterday](/2020/06/01/osprey) I forgot to say that the Osprey is most notable for its habit of [diving into lakes to catch fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=428L7cR4AMU), something few other raptors do, and no others do so spectacularly. The Peregrine is also the master of a remarkable feat of flying, reaching the highest speeds of any creature on the planet when it dives &mdash; or _stoops_ &mdash; from astonishing heights at up to 200mph to catch its prey in mid air, usually a pigeon or similarly sized bird.

And yet today, that’s where the mood, in no uncertain terms, took me.

The first time in weeks the sky has not been blue. Earlier in the day, on my first walk, cotton-wool clouds hovered over the lakes beneath a whited-out layer of nimbus, letting loose the odd drop of rain. By the evening the rising wind had strung them out into a monotonous blanket of quilted greys. \n\nI had high hopes for today, but the weather didn't deliver. Specifically, it wasn't as _bad_ as I'd hoped it would be. Rain and wind of the right sort at the right time are the birdwatcher's most trusted allies.\n\nDespite being a birdwatcher, of varying levels of dedication, for most of my life this is only something I've learned in the last couple of years. My time at Walthamstow is the first time I've had much to do with other birdwatchers as an adult. \n\nBirdwatching has generally been something I do, in part, to get away from it all, which includes other people. However, visiting the same local patch week in, week out means I now cross paths with the same crowd regularly, so stopping for a chat with other birdwatchers is now a welcome part of my life. Much of the conversation, as you'd expect, is about birds &mdash; \"Much about?\" is the stock conversation starter &mdash; but even within this narrow sphere there's much variety to be had.\n\nFrom the people I've got to know on the patch I've learned so much more of the craft of birding than I ever figured out alone. \n\nI've learned to rise early on October mornings, particularly with an Easterly wind, and look for thrushes and finches flying overhead, nearing the end of their nocturnal migration from Scandinavia and other parts of continental Europe (this is known as vizmig &mdash; \"visible migration\" &mdash; season).\n\nI've learned that the arrival of most summer migrants can be pinpointed almost to the day, with each species having a very precise time at which they return to the breeding grounds. Someone will post on our Whatsapp group, \"Looks good for Whinchat tomorrow,\" and, sure enough, one will turn up the very next day in the Bombcrater field.\n\nAnd I now know that rain and wind are not the curses I once considered them to be. At the right time of year, particularly during peak migration periods, a band of heavy rain can cause unexpected migrants to descend. They would rather pass by high overhead, with the great metropolis well out of earshot, but tired wings and waterlogged feathers force them to seek refuge at the nearest expanse of water or undergrowth. Add in a breeze from the right direction and the chances of a real rarity turning up are greatly increased, outweighing the negative effect wind tends to have on the mobility, and hence visiblity, of most small birds.\n\nBut today did not deliver. The brief heavy rain was localised enough for any migrants to avoid and &mdash; monday's [osprey](/2020-06-01/osprey) notwithstanding &mdash; it _is_ getting a bit late in the season to hope for many migrants anyway.

It chugs on. Today planned around the roughly weekly shop. Adaptable creatures we are, and I socially distance myself from the same 3 other humans as we each forage up and down the aisles at the same modest pace. My favourite bread is back on the shelves and I pick up a six pack of crisps on the way to the tills. The beeps of the self-checkout trigger a memory and I start huming the theme tune to The Simpsons.\n\nWalking back home down Coppermill Lane I watch a sparrowhawk circling above the rooftops, perfectly balanced around its midrif, stumpy wings arched like acanthus leaves and its long tail cantilevered behind. It wouldn't look out of place hanging from a mobile.\n\nMy last day before returning to work and a slightly stiff back precludes my cycling the distance to the Black Lives Matter protest, I nevertheless decide to make the most of the time by cycling the mile or so to Hackney marsh in search of the little owls that have taken up residency since January. No sign of them today, predictable though their behaviour is. The owl box has vegitation sticking out of its entrance, so nest building appears to be underway.\n\nNot wanting to waste my journey south, I head to the waterworks reserve in search of one of the summer's less consistent singers. Most warblers that spend their summer in the UK sing consistently all summer. Today I heard the unsurprising singing of chiffchaff, blackcap, whitethroat and reed warbler. it's rare that a day goes by when I don't. \n\nBut some warblers seem to go quiet as soon as they've established a territory and found a mate. Lesser whitethroat, garden warbler and, to a lesser degree, sedge warbler, become verbal recluses from June onwards. It's particularly notable in lesser whitethroat; I haven't heard one for a couple of weeks at least, but in April there were at least 8 males holding territories and singing their distinctive jangle, sounding like eggs being beaten with a fork in a metal pan. The waterworks is known for its pair of garden warblers, that year on year return (or send their offspring) to the same bushes in the centre of the reserve.\n\nMy twenties are a period relatively devoid of birdwatching. It wasn't until about the age of 26 that I obtained my own pair of binoculars (a Christmas present), and prior to that I would not have spent any time birdwatching aside from on visits back home to Wales. When I brought them back to London with me, the waterworks reserve was my haunt.\n\nAt the time I was living in Bow, close to the canal, and the waterworks was about a fifteen minute cycle, past Victoria Park, Hackney Wick (in those days still an industrial wasteland) and the uncountably many football pitches on Hackney Marshes. The waterworks was, as far as I knew, the only publically accessable nature reserve within cycling distance; it amuses me to think that at the time I considered Walthamstow to be in the same category as the \"Here be dragons\" sections on ancient maps, when nowadays I think nothing of zooming across 4 boroughs on my bike.\n\n![image](/assets/img/waterworks-pool.jpg)\n\nBack then the reserve was also far better maintained. An old water filtration plant, at its centre is the old water pump surrounded by a circular wooden screen with benches and bird hide slats to view the six old filter beds that surround it. Until recently information boards detailed how each bed was maintained in a specific state &mdash; from deep water to wet woodland &mdash; in order to recreate the typical ecological trajectory a wetland habit travels along. A decade of, one has to presume, underfunding has meant the boards became more of an aspiration than a reality, and they were recently taken down, replaced by one covering the industrial history of the site.\n\nNow three of the beds are largely covered in reedbeds which is not a disaster I guess, but I do miss the wintering green sandpiper, and a dozen or more snipe probing the carefully maintained, more open beds of yesteryear with their stupidly long beaks.\n\nAnother loss to the reserve over the same time period is the colony of sand martins. Two concrete cylinders with holes drilled in the side and stuffed full of sandy earth provided homes for many pairs, year after year, but they have fallen somewhat into disrepair, and perhaps the taller vegetation is not to the sand martins' liking.\n\nThey have not completely disappeared though &mdash; they breed in man made pipes jutting out of the canal bank in Clapton &mdash; and today they claim the only open water left at the reserve as their own. Skimming just above the water, avoiding the brownian meanderings of four cootlets, they beg to be written about, but are overshadowed by the pair of **Grey Wagtail** that nest right in the centre of the old water pump.\n\nGrey wagtails are a bird I used to think of as being distinctly Welsh. Not that they are unique to wales &mdash; no bird is &mdash; but they feature on the visitor guides to many typically welsh nature reserves. Those replete with steep sided valleys draped in mossy oak trees through which cascades a crystal clear or peaty brown stream. In the trees &mdash; the brochure boasts &mdash; can be found wood warbler, pied flycatcher and redstart, and down by the stream the attentive visitor will be rewarded with sights of look for dippers bobbing up and down and grey wagtails feeding on the water-borne insects.\n\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/01.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/02.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/03.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/04.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/05.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/06.jpg)\n\nI shouldn't be surprised, as there are few waterways in London I haven't seen them next to, but grey wagtails are at least as common in the capital as their far more urbane pied cousin. Today, the welsh tourist board's loss is my gain as they provide me with half an hour of joy and drama to more than make up for yesterday's \"typical\" June doldrums.\n\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/07.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/08.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/09.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/10.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/11.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/12.jpg)\n\nToday I'm alerted to their presence, as is usually the case, by their clear piping contact call &mdash; the call birds make at irregular intervals just to let their kin know they're around. \"Pwip-pip!\", it goes, a sweet sound that does seem more fitting beside a mountain stream. The male has a similarly bright song, without much discernible tune, like a choir boy attempting a footbal chant.\n\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/13.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/14.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/15.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/16.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/17.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/18.jpg)\n\n\"Grey\" is a strange name for these birds as the immediate impression they give is of yellowness. Not quite as yellow as the yellow wagtail, which almost burn the eyes with the most vivid colour in nature, but still an impressively bright plumage. Both male and female sport bright yellow rumps and undertails; when flying away this always catches the eye. The male also has a neat black chin, bolder in some than others, and a lemon yellow flush to its breast, with the female the same but coloured as though the pens were running low on ink. Both have half realised white eyebrows, sometimes looking furiously bushy in front of their eyes. Aside from that they are a smooth, steel grey, stylish in an understated way, but hardly their defining feature.\n\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/19.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/20.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/21.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/22.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/23.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/24.jpg)\n\nIf their name can't do justice to their plumage it should, at the very least, do justice to their shape by capitalising the WAGTAIL. Ridiculously long, they are wagged up and down incessantly on land, and trail behind like a lollipop stick when during their spring-loaded, bounding flight. On landing the tail is often held at a slight upward angle, as though tugging at a sternly held leash. \n\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/25.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/26.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/27.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/28.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/29.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/30.jpg)\n\nImmature birds are beginning to emerge from their nests. I've seen three in the past week. Their far shorter tails are still wagged up and down with a determined desire to impress the parents. Watching the pair and their child lined up on the steep concrete bank today, the youngster struggling for a foothold on the crumbly, slippery moss, their movements reminded me of a row of lucky waving cat statues in a Chinese takeaway. \n\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/31.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/32.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/33.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/34.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/35.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/36.jpg)\n\nWagtails have two main methods of feeding. They strut about on open ground searching for tiny creepy crawlies but, far more entertaingly, choose a favourite perch and fly on repeated short sortees to catch insects on the wing. They hover and pirhouette in the air like tinkerbell, reaching their fine bills out to take an insect as if casting a spell with their magic wand, then return to catch their breath back on solid ground.\n\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/37.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/38.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/39.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/40.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/41.jpg)\n![image](/assets/img/grey-wagtail-storyboard/42.jpg)\n\nWhen two amateur historians lean over the balustrade to peer into the chambers of the old water pump &mdash; a little too close to the nest for comfort &mdash; the adults let out a rapid series of urgent peeps, but this is nothing to the alarm call they reserve for when a grey-brown female sparrowhawk &mdash; the same one as this morning? &mdash; parachutes in to try its luck. \"Swee-eee!\" sound their tiny sirens, and the alarms continue while the hawk skulks in the foliage of a nearby birch tree.\n\nI do not see if the young one is safe. It would be a short life indeed. Its legs were still baby pink.\n\nThe tiny dramas of life and death that take place around us.\n\nThe sand martins all left at once. A stock dove flies in to drink nearby, but no-one feels like pretending things are back to normal. Five little grebes, in a drama that would hit the front page on a quieter news day, brawl over territory in the far corner of the pool.\n\nHungry, I leave the soap opera and head for home. I hear what sounds like a garden warbler from the usual bushes, but it's half past three and I haven't eaten lunch.\n\nI should have brought some crisps.\n\nP.S.

Aside from some occasional rudeness, I generally get a respectful response. On one occasion a white middle class jogger got very uppity with me and another birder and his choice of words really stayed with me: \"Do I _look_ like the kind of person who would break the rules?\". As is often the case, the perfect riposte only came to me later: \"Do tell me, what _does_ someone who would break the rules look like?\"\n\nFollowing George Floyd's death last week a few people, including Dara O'Brian revealed that they tell _their_, \"I got caught with a forged bank note,\" stories as annecdotes. The very idea they could've lost their lives over it seems absurd, but unfortunately it's not if you're black.\n\nEarlier this week I watched [Trevor Noah give his take on the Black Lives Matter protests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4amCfVbA_c), and I learned more about the other racist-white-america story of the week. That a birdwatcher in Central Park, doing exactly what I do without fear every day, was faced with _\"a woman who [...] knew how to use the power of her whiteness to threaten the life of another man and his blackness\"_.\n\nWhite privilege gets everywhere I guess. \n\nBirdwatching is largely a white men's club, and I do sometimes feel highly aware of, and quietly amused by, this. I'd never properly considered that white privilege, unconscious bias, structural racism and related factors could play a part in it being how it is, but it is an _overwhelmingly_ white activity in a massively multicultural city. That doesn't sit well. \n\nI'm not sure what I can do in the niche intersection between birdwatching and racial equality, but I feel like it should be something. Isn't the first step to recognise there's a problem? And the second to be an ally?\n\nSo I think I'll take the binoculars to Kensington Gardens tomorrow on my way to the protest. Might find some little owls. [#BlackBirdersWeek](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackBirdersWeek)\n\n...\n\nI had a target bird to write about today, but it didn't show. There's a bush on the marshes which a particularly strident and confiding Song Thrush uses as its song post. This morning it had better things to do than entertain me. Kids to feed?\n\nSo I fell back to writing some notes about the sedge warblers. They are always fun, with songs like the cacaphonous recording of all the trainsets at a model railway enthusiast's convention. I wasn't planning on going out again, so the brief and distant views I had of one would have to do for visual interest. It felt like a disservice to such a characterful bird to be rolled on as an understudy.\n\nBefore it went into make-up though it was rescued by the arrival of a far more impressive contender. \n\nI cycled to B&Q again to buy a tenon saw; yesterday's skee-whiff attempt at joining two pieces of wood had me, the bad workman, blaming my tools (though I had a point as any saw other than a tenon really won't do for joinery). I was reminded of the first job I ever held down for more than a few weeks, stacking shelves at my local branch of B&Q. I was 17 and a woman telling her son not to bother me was the first time I ever got called a man. One night a door fell from the shelves onto my head, giving me the slightly crooked nose I have to this day. They were more innocent times, and no \"Have you ever been injured at work?\" adverts tempted me to sue, but I definitely deserved compensation.\n\nI cycled back along Forest Road, between High Maynard and No. 4 reservoirs.  The sky still ran thick with swifts and I paused for a moment to watch them zooming too and fro above me. A young starling almost landed on my head, but was urged on by its parent to try the jagged Thames Water perimeter fence instead. The adult had cobwebs laden with willow seed fluff stuck to its back, but seemed unconcerned by how ridiculous it looked. All dressed up for Halloween before the summer solstice has even passed.\n\nThey scampered off as a distinctly predatory silhouette approached. In the few seconds it was visible I noted it's slender pointed wings and thanked my lucky stars to have had a hobby cross my path.\n\nLast year the hobby was my totemic bird. It may have been finding a showy Avocet that others in the birdwatching group seem to remember me by, but to the best of my knowledge nobody else saw a hobby on the patch last year... and I saw three. This year, however, there have been plenty of sightings &mdash; I myself have seen them three times already &mdash; leading to speculation that they're breeding nearby.\n\nSurprisingly, by the end of the day not even the regal hobby could retain the crown for the day's most magical birdwatching moment. That was provided by a far less glamorous suitor.\n\nRain was forecast for the afternoon so I went out to the reservoirs after all, as much for the weather as for the birds. I'm not so much of a masochist as to enjoy _every_ downpour, but something in my North-Walian soul feels cheated by a month without rain.\n\n![image](/assets/img/west-warwick.jpg)\n\nLeaving the main public path I took the underpass beneath the railway line to West Warwick reservoir. Completely closed to the public, and hidden behind the railway tracks, the atmosphere here is very different to the rest of reserve. The grass on the banks is greener, and the water's edge is lined with more reeds. Though it has the life and bustle of Clapton canal-side within sight and earshot, it could easily be a lagoon in a remote Estonian marsh.\n\n![image](/assets/img/doom-clouds.jpg)\n\nMenacing clouds slowly drifted in from the west. The squally wind that heavy rain clouds often send on ahead arrived, drawing a special \"Wind grin\" (suitable for mountain tops) from my face, but then the cloud loosed only a few meagre drops of rain. After it passed, beyond I could see rain reaching down to the ground in tendrils the same colour as the clouds, a deep, bruise-blue shadow. You can tell how heavy the rain will be by the shape reaching down to brush the ground; silk handkerchieves or a solid broom of grey. I learned this when birdwatching on The Wirral in my teens.\n\nEven though the rain was poor, the grass still soaked my trainers. Wet feet &mdash; what joy!\n\nI watched the many swifts slicing and dicing the air above the lake, and started to film their breakneck trajectories when I spotted a dark bird flying low, swift and steady over the water. I immediately grabbed my bins to confirm what my birdwatcher's instinct already told me I'd seen &mdash; a **Swallow**.\n\nSwallows, as [mentioned yesterday](/2020/06/04/house-martin), are not city birds, so I did need to double check. I thought I'd heard one &mdash; sounding like a tape played backwards &mdash; on the marshes about a week ago, and possibly seen two in the distance on the reservoirs the same [day I saw the osprey](/2020/06/01/osprey). There is hope they are breeding somewhere not too far away in the valley.\n\nWhen I was young, swallows had a reputation as colourful birds, the quintessential exotic summer migrant from Africa. When I was seven years old we took part in an art activity which involved colouring in the outline of a swallow; you can imagine how gaudy our efforts were. It was the eighties, so arts and crafts technology was not as advanced as today's, but I believe felt tip pens were involved.\n\nA few days later an actual swallow flew into our living room window, dying in the process. I begged to take it to school to be added to our \"Bwrdd natur\" (\"Nature table\", the welsh rural equivalent of what I think English speaking schools call \"Show and tell\"). The fascinating thing, I remember our teacher explaining to the class, is that the swallow was nowhere near as colourful as our imaginations. Truth is drabber than fiction.\n\nOn paper, in bird books, the swallow doesn't look too dreary, with a dapper navy blue back, cream front and bold red chin and forehead. It could almost be the inspiration for the Napoleonic army's uniforms. But in real life the cream is muddied, the red darkens to art-school Doctor Marten boot dark, and the contrasting dark blue back is lost in the silhouetting of the bird against water or sky.\n\nBut what the swallow has... what it has that no washed out drizzle, fog or glare can conceal, is one of the most graceful flights of any british bird. It appears truly effortless, both steady and exhilirating at the same time. They tend to fly low and straight over the water, travelling with the unhurried, lithe movements of a speed skater, wing over wing languidly drawing speed from thin air. To change direction they climb, loop and dive down like a skateboarder pulling tricks in the skate park. Swallows seem to be on rollers or rails of some sort, their economical movements serving only to trip them from one perfect curve to the next.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/dragonfly.jpg\" style=\"float:right\" />\n\nThrough the medium of its flight it's other charms are revealed. Its forked tail ends in two pointed streamers, and beneath it two white eye-diamonds of feathers can be seen, printed in a hidden away spot like the subtle hallmark of a master craftsman. And, in the right light, the glossy blue back does have its day, a negative image mother-of-pearl sheen shimmering on its shoulders.\n\nI sat watching for an age, treasuring each moment, and hoping it stays the summer.\n\nI went on with my walk, passing a fisherman fast asleep in his fishing tent, an exhausted dragonfly cowering on the ground and a juvenile pied wagtail &mdash; the first of this year's nestlings to fledge. \n\nThe wind whipped up again, the foot-high waves crashing on the shore and making a sound like geese bathing. For the first time in months I needed to put the rain-guard onto my bins. I yelled \"Ya blockos\" ecstatically at the weather as the _real rain_ came charging out of the sky. As it passed a subtle low rainbow hung between cloud and earth, and the maelstrom, polyped and swollen like a sow's belly, made its escape to the east.\n![image](/assets/img/sows-belly2.jpg)\n[Main image credit](https://pixabay.com/photos/swallow-flying-swallow-in-flight-5228993/)","src/data/birds/2020-06-05-swallow.md","368f37b19069fe0a",{"html":473,"metadata":474},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/swallow.jpg\" alt=\"image\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"black-birders-week-preamble\">Black birders week preamble\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I regularly chastise people for infringing regulations at the Walthamstow reserve designed to keep it safe for wildlife. Aside from some occasional rudeness, I generally get a respectful response. On one occasion a white middle class jogger got very uppity with me and another birder and his choice of words really stayed with me: “Do I \u003Cem>look\u003C/em> like the kind of person who would break the rules?”. As is often the case, the perfect riposte only came to me later: “Do tell me, what \u003Cem>does\u003C/em> someone who would break the rules look like?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Following George Floyd’s death last week a few people, including Dara O’Brian revealed that they tell \u003Cem>their\u003C/em>, “I got caught with a forged bank note,” stories as annecdotes. The very idea they could’ve lost their lives over it seems absurd, but unfortunately it’s not if you’re black.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Earlier this week I watched \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4amCfVbA_c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Trevor Noah give his take on the Black Lives Matter protests\u003C/a>, and I learned more about the other racist-white-america story of the week. That a birdwatcher in Central Park, doing exactly what I do without fear every day, was faced with \u003Cem>“a woman who […] knew how to use the power of her whiteness to threaten the life of another man and his blackness”\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>White privilege gets everywhere I guess.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Birdwatching is largely a white men’s club, and I do sometimes feel highly aware of, and quietly amused by, this. I’d never properly considered that white privilege, unconscious bias, structural racism and related factors could play a part in it being how it is, but it is an \u003Cem>overwhelmingly\u003C/em> white activity in a massively multicultural city. That doesn’t sit well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’m not sure what I can do in the niche intersection between birdwatching and racial equality, but I feel like it should be something. Isn’t the first step to recognise there’s a problem? And the second to be an ally?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I think I’ll take the binoculars to Kensington Gardens tomorrow on my way to the protest. Might find some little owls. \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackBirdersWeek\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">#BlackBirdersWeek\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had a target bird to write about today, but it didn’t show. There’s a bush on the marshes which a particularly strident and confiding Song Thrush uses as its song post. This morning it had better things to do than entertain me. Kids to feed?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I fell back to writing some notes about the sedge warblers. They are always fun, with songs like the cacaphonous recording of all the trainsets at a model railway enthusiast’s convention. I wasn’t planning on going out again, so the brief and distant views I had of one would have to do for visual interest. It felt like a disservice to such a characterful bird to be rolled on as an understudy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Before it went into make-up though it was rescued by the arrival of a far more impressive contender.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I cycled to B&#x26;Q again to buy a tenon saw; yesterday’s skee-whiff attempt at joining two pieces of wood had me, the bad workman, blaming my tools (though I had a point as any saw other than a tenon really won’t do for joinery). I was reminded of the first job I ever held down for more than a few weeks, stacking shelves at my local branch of B&#x26;Q. I was 17 and a woman telling her son not to bother me was the first time I ever got called a man. One night a door fell from the shelves onto my head, giving me the slightly crooked nose I have to this day. They were more innocent times, and no “Have you ever been injured at work?” adverts tempted me to sue, but I definitely deserved compensation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I cycled back along Forest Road, between High Maynard and No. 4 reservoirs.  The sky still ran thick with swifts and I paused for a moment to watch them zooming too and fro above me. A young starling almost landed on my head, but was urged on by its parent to try the jagged Thames Water perimeter fence instead. The adult had cobwebs laden with willow seed fluff stuck to its back, but seemed unconcerned by how ridiculous it looked. All dressed up for Halloween before the summer solstice has even passed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They scampered off as a distinctly predatory silhouette approached. In the few seconds it was visible I noted it’s slender pointed wings and thanked my lucky stars to have had a hobby cross my path.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Last year the hobby was my totemic bird. It may have been finding a showy Avocet that others in the birdwatching group seem to remember me by, but to the best of my knowledge nobody else saw a hobby on the patch last year… and I saw three.

I will miss my leisurely two to three hour strolls in the afternoon. But still, I get my hours docked by 10% soon, so there's that to look forward to.\n\nIn continuation of yesterday's quest to find midsummer's shyest warblers I headed north at lunch to Tottenham East Marsh, a reliable spot for lesser whitethroat.\n\nI commented yesterday on my embarrassing reluctance in my younger days to explore further north east than Hackney. I've been shown up again since lockdown. As I venture further and further affield to add variety, and spice, to life, I discover delightful places that are a shamefully short hop away, but that I had never once visited before.\n\nThere's Gilbert's Slade Wood in Snaresbrook, maybe three miles away up a pleasantly invigorating incline. There's the tern colony at Ponder's End five miles up the canal. But most embarrassingly of all is Tottenham East Marsh, which _I can see_ over a fence from the north end of Lockwood reservoir, but in almost two years hadn't investigated how to get into this area of meadow and scrub that was clearly open to the public.\n\nThis spring the meadow gradually filled with cow parsley as the local populace, at a similar stately pace, evolved their interpretation of what the spirit of lockdown had to say about pausing for a little in this enclave well out of the reach of the sharp eyes of the law. That is until about a month ago when most of the meadow was cordonned off after an abandoned moped was discovered, and police searched for evidence relating to a Tottenham shooting.\n\nI've not seen, or heard, a lesser whitethroat here since before then, though I don't mean to cast aspersions on its good name.\n\nOn arrival I hear a pheasant retching &mdash; my first of the year in the valley &mdash; who live wild here. I once saw one on a patch of grass in Dalston, at around the time that it was _a la mode_ to fill a pub's interior with stuffed animals and mounted skulls. It's presence was a mystery to me at the time, but I imagine it would have made its way there from this local stock.\n\nI don't trouble to look for the bird. This is partly because it's a pheasant and, despite their impressive looks and regal gait, they are an introduced species, and in most of the country gamekeepers have a hand in maintaining their populations; this \"cheating\" earns them a lot of opprobium. The same goes for ring-necked parakeets. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.\n\nThe other reason I don't try to find it is that the vegetation is far too dense. The tall stems of cow parsley are dying back and, in collapsing, form a dense weave. Through this the next wave of wildflowers and grasses grow. Between their stems, birds and mammals, and perhaps the odd reptile, are free to worm their way undisturbed.\n\nThis is another reason why June and July birding is less rewarding. In April and May most trees and undergrowth are either in bud or have relatively small and translucent foliage. Not only are the summer migrants all newly arrived, excitable and in song, but their hiding places have not yet fully developed. Hearing a bird in full song is, more often than not, followed by good views of it puffing out its throat feathers in time with the bellows inside. But times change.\n\nI stand for a moment in a small clearing with bushes and trees on all sides. Aside from a blackbird &mdash; large, loud-mouthed and perched in the open after a belly-flopping flight into the thiner twigs &mdash; I see no birds, though I hear a good few. Dunnock and Robin are singing from cover, and a chiffchaff chiffs and chaffs from the top of some tree; earlier in the spring I'd easily have spotted its dinky silhouette among the birch catkins, but today, singing from the exact same position, it's an enigma. \n\nI loiter for ten or fifteen minutes, hoping the lesser whitethroat &mdash; who really do appear to go on the run for a while in midsummer &mdash; will pop a silent, hooded head out of the elder trees. I hear some muffled, wheezy cheeps and a couple of small grey blurs dart into the open for a split second before diving back in to cover. I'm not sure what a lesser whitethroat's calls are like, only having learned to recognise the song, so I optimistically follow in hot pursuit.\n\nAfter a few minutes peering past the closest layer of leaves and through to the barer branches beyond, I find the source of the wheezes; a podgy juvenile **Blackcap**, whining for its next meal. With a sandy brown cap &mdash; less sharply cut than its mother's chestnut and father's black headwear &mdash; a soft, pale base to its beak and an endearingly dark eye it squats on the branch, unsure of itself, and then flits off. A moment later I see its neatly tailored father peering at me from a nearby twig. \"You ain't seen nuffink, you ain't 'eard nuffink,\" it says and then dashes back to the underworld. \n\nHearing the song of a blackcap from a countryside path is one of the most dependable signs of spring. Although a few continental birds now winter here, those head off to Germany for the summer. A blackcap in full song is a sure sign that the birds from southern Europe and Africa have, using whatever mysterious meterological tools are available to them, deemed our windy but warming isle to be suitable for the purposes of rearing young. They return in their droves.\n\nOne of our commonest birds in summer, even small patches of scrub or trees will most likely host one. If you have a garden with a tree or two there's a fair chance a blackcap will have made its home there.\n\nBut so easy to miss. Without a familiarity with their song, that is. When I first started to birdwatch seriously in my teens, the blackcap was one of the first bird songs I learned.\n\nNo, that's not quite accurate; one of the first bird songs I remember trying hard, and repeatedly failng, to learn. It's more intractable and varied than many of the other common ones, and easy to misidentify. Some refer to the blackcap as the nightingale of the north, which I think is overstating it, but it does have its moments. They will often begin by grinding and churring, like radio static, before tuning in to the beautiful aria they were trying to transmit. \n\nA virtuoso male toyed with me for several days earlier this spring, singing the traditional flutey ballads from an exposed perch in an oriental tree before diving into the undergrowth and letting rip a jarring medley of whines, clicks and whirrs it was putting together for its art-rock side project.

Humid and overcast, and not too cold, insects fill the air on days like these. \n\nI've always assumed that they coordinate their emergence from millions of pupae for a brief flight to find a mate, and that atmospheric conditions are the trigger. But, like songbirds going to ground on windy days and then flitting busily about the following day, maybe they are there all along, only sheltering.\n\nParking up at the bike racks and laying the 2m post I'd bought to rest on the ground (safe, surely - no one would nick a piece of wood... off the ground... at a _nature reserve_... would they??) I sauntered off down the central path, where two canada geese &mdash; an unusually large male and small female &mdash; stood guard.\n\nThe central path, which winds its way between reservoirs Number 1, 2 and 3 (by the end of this series of blogs, I will try to give them better names), is closed to the public during the summer months because it overlooks the heronry. Rooks have their rookeries, Gannets have their gannetries and Herons have their heronries and, as far as I know, that's the full extent of self-referencial naming of birds' breeding colonies (unless you count the artificial [Abbotsbury Swannery](https://abbotsbury-tourism.co.uk/swannery/)).\n\nI'm not sure why Gannets, in particular, deserve to have a special word minted just for them; their breeding habits are not exceptional as seabirds go. The vast majority of their fellow cliff and island nesting species also gather in enormous, noisy, guano-spattered festivals of chick-rearing. In fact, we have a colony of their close relatives, the Cormorant, whitewashing the trees of the No. 5 reservoir islands with their faeces every year.\n\nBut I can see why Rooks and Herons get such special treatment. Very few of our inland species nest in colonies. Not being constrained to find a spot on the edge of the land, next to their native habitat of the sea, land-lubbers can &mdash; and generally do &mdash; spread out, needing nothing more than a suitable tree, bush or scrape of earth to lay eggs in, all of which there is a [rapidly shrinking] abundance of.\n\nHerons and Rooks, however, nest together in the tops of trees, using the same nests year on year. Herons will usually choose trees on an island in a lake (they are waterbirds, after all), whereas Rooks favour trees in a copse or near the edge of a large woodland. Both are noisy affairs, and are visual landmarks, both in their own way; the herons slowly turning their unlucky trees into ghostly wrecks, and the rooks' nests pimpling the treetops with dark spots, while the birds congregate above.\n\nThe crematorium gardens in my hometown had a vocal Rookery. It would solemnly broadcast a chorus of drawn out caws &mdash; mellower and more speech-like than a common crow's &mdash; over each funeral. I'd gaze up in wonder as they repaired their nests each spring &mdash; curious highlight of every April 10th, when we'd visit to pay our respects to my father. When I attended an old neighbour's funeral in February they had gone. \n\n...\n\nI wondered on, past the poplar trees shwoosing in the, from time to time, substantial breeze. Their brittle, fallen sibling, toppled in the February storms (how long ago that seems), lay across the fence, still crushed and unrepaired, and the trunk still intact and un-logged. Non-essential work.\n\nOver towards No. 5 I could see swifts &mdash; dozens of them &mdash; skating circles and figure-eights through the air. \n\nDays like today, the air thick with insects, particularly close to water, are almost guaranteed to attract swifts and hirundines (the term for swallows and their relatives). The abundance of insects I liken to the opening of an ikea store, with each bird rushing to fill its trolley in case the shelves are stripped. I had assumed today marked the bloom of a particular species of fly, but tiny midges, leafhoppers, moths, aphids and thrips all landed on my legs to be photographed. It's a buffet, not a set meal.\n\n![image](/assets/img/insect1.jpg)![image](/assets/img/insect2.jpg)![image](/assets/img/insect3.jpg)![image](/assets/img/insect4.jpg)![image](/assets/img/insect5.jpg)![image](/assets/img/insect6.jpg)\n\nWhich birds will be feeding on this menu is anybody's guess. Sometimes the sky will be full of swifts with only a handful of the other species, and on other days sand or house martins will be all there is. Today was fortunate in having dozens, if not hundreds, of each one.\n\nBut it's the **House Martins** that delighted me the most.\n\nFor city dwellers the sight of a swallow is a rare thing as they are primarily birds of the countryside. Sand martins are also less frequent a sight, restricted to areas close to the sandy river banks where they nest in arrays of patiently dug tunnels. But house martins can be found (in reduced numbers compared to years gone by) wherever there are suitable eaves under which to attach their mud cup nest.\n\nBright white underneath and blue-black above, save for an equally bright white rump, they dart playfully along, drinking the air with little slurping sounds or, more humorously, sounding as if they are propelled by a constant stream of tiny farts. Elegant and graceful compared to most other birds in flight, the house martin is still the most mechanical, least fluid flyer of its family, but still a joy to watch. With a longer, more deeply forked tail than the sand martin, they manouver in a sometimes angular modern dance. One flies within inches of my ear, chirrupping loudly; what are you saying, little one?\n\nThere always seems to be some chase or other going on, with orderly queues of three or four birds forming in pursuit of a meal or each other. They are far and away the most garrulous of the three species dining out on the lake, always engaged in gossipping, or perhaps trash-talk. The sand martins progress mainly in silence, occasionally updating each other over a crackly walkie talkie. The swifts, despite their reputation for screaming, were largely silent today. Perhaps their mouths were full.\n\nAs they all feasted, I sat by the lake and wide-eyed watched until my shirtless arms grew cold. Turning for home, the air above the lake was still drenched in birds. \n\n[Main image credit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sbern/9028343274)","src/data/birds/2020-06-04-house-martin.md","113d89dda1018c95",{"html":549,"metadata":550},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/house-martin.jpg\" alt=\"image\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stopping off on my cycle to B&#x26;Q to take a closer look at a Grey Wagtail, my forearms acquired a light dusting of tiny flies.

One flies within inches of my ear, chirrupping loudly; what are you saying, little one?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There always seems to be some chase or other going on, with orderly queues of three or four birds forming in pursuit of a meal or each other. They are far and away the most garrulous of the three species dining out on the lake, always engaged in gossipping, or perhaps trash-talk. The sand martins progress mainly in silence, occasionally updating each other over a crackly walkie talkie. The swifts, despite their reputation for screaming, were largely silent today. Perhaps their mouths were full.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As they all feasted, I sat by the lake and wide-eyed watched until my shirtless arms grew cold.

In April and early May I'd frequently awake early, sensing it streaming in through the blinds, obey my body clock's summons to rise up, and be out of the door by 7 o'clock.

The wasted opportunities for crisp morning light, dewy meadows and post-dawn foxes passing by unlived. Heavy eyelids and a full head of hayfever binding me to my bed.\n\nThis morning was, reluctantly, different. I'd arranged to meet a friend to seek out the **Song Thrush** we'd been entertained by in early May on an even earlier dawn chorus excursion.

It has altered its favourite song post since earlier in the spring as the brambles have grown almost to the same height as the shrub it perched upon. It now favours a small tree next to the canal path, and perches facing away from us. I fancy it enjoys the echo of its song bouncing back from the walls across the water, and waking the inhabitants of the canal boats from both directions.\n\nAnd wake them it would. The song thrush is one of the loudest and most persistent songsters we have. It will sing for great lengths of time delivering a mixture of strident, repeated whistles and chuckles and short playful ditties using both its voice boxes to the full. The purity and volume of its standard repertoire is an invigorating tonic at any time of day, but aprticularly enjoyable in the early evening when they will often repeat the kind of showstopping performance most birds reserve for the dawn.\n\nLike many of our most tuneful songbirds, the song thrush is prone to mimicry or, if not mimicry, it has an uncanny knack for sounding incongruously modern. It sings sounds not unlike a telephone with its battery running out, and at one point sounds like a morose car central-locking itself. It looks over its shoulder, a steady dark eye pering out of a speckled poker face.

I missed out on the morning's rain and had to make do with a stroll through its muggy slipstream.\n\nI cycled up the main track, irritated by the flies kamikazeing into my face, and around the top of East Warwick. I passed my bike through the gap where one of the slats of the wooden fence had been dislodged. Locking it up I saw that the landscapers' vans were in.\n\nTwo young men directed remote controlled sit-down mowers around the banks of West Warwick. Mowing long grass on roadside verges is often deemed needless environmental vandalism, but I have it on good authority that the vegetation around the reservoirs must be cut back regularly in order to avoid cracks in the dams growing unnoticed.\n\nAround the top of the reservoir at least four reed warblers sang their glitchy starter motor songs from the narrow strip of reeds. They really do cram themselves in. There will be four neatly woven nests bound to the reed stems, with tiny eggs or wide open beaks within. The reeds rustle in the breeze.\n\nA single swift charges over the water; its brethren circle high up in the sky despite the abundant swarms of flies. The sun breaks through the clouds. I am wearing jeans and its cloying warmth is unwelcome.\n\nDozens of slim, electric blue damselflies glide their horizontal bodies out of the way of my strides. They look like graphics from the film Tron. It's ard to focus on them as they glow and dissipate inches above the grass.\n\nA blue butterly. Purple knapweed. A red-tailed bee.\n\nYellow buttercups, dandelions and ragwort.\n\nAnd orange brown leaves.\n\nIt's a day to gaze down into the grass rather than up at the sky. \n\nThe swallow of four days ago is absent. A thrush, a robin and a blackbird sing anonymously from the trees, and the same juvenile pied wagtail, adrift from its family, still haunts the water's edge. Across the water I hear the excitable ululating song of a little grebe.\n\nA cloud of white flowers, dog rose I think, encrusts a large shrub, and over towards the railway tracks the ever-thickening bastilles of bramble are also in bloom. We think of them as thorny, aggressive, impenetrable and, later, country kitchen berry-laden, but the pink-white bramble flower is little noticed. They are everywhere these weeks. At the waterworks on monday they were crowded with bees of all kinds humming with honey.\n\nAt one edge of the thorny citadel a few birds chatter nervously. The sounds have the clipped roundness of a finch, but I'm unsure which. I see one dart into the open, with what looks like a white-based tail on an otherwise bland faun body. Through binoculars I see that the white is bright yellow and I am looking at a young **Greenfinch**, yet to gain the leaf green plumage that gives them their name.\n\nIt's followed by another three birds, the bright yellow flash of their tails seeming out of place. Why, if they are drab and camouflaged to protect their young, unworldly bodies, is their most conspicuous adult feature preserved. Other than that they'd be non-descript in the extreme, identifiable only by their silly big heads.\n\nI hope they make it to adulthood. The greenfinch has taken a tumble in recent decades. Formerly one of our commonest birds, changes to farming methods followed by the spread of a deadly virus we can all relate well to mean they are now on the British red list; one of the british species of highest conservation concern. They seem to be doing better locally, after a few particularly lean years. Earlier this spring males circling the Lea Bridge paddocks on undulating, front-heavy aeronautical flights while singing the intro to \"Sorted for E's and Whizz\" were a feature of many mornings. And they wheeze their other one note descending song near the wetlands Engine House most days.\n\nOn the final stretch of my circumnavigation I reach the edge of the mown grass and find a spiny black caterpillar &mdash; a peacock butterfly I think &mdash; crawling along. I pick it up, throw it deep into the safe zone and walk on, counting the reed warblers as I go.\n\n![brambles](/assets/img/brambles.jpg)\n\n[Main image credit](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chlorisjuvenilposado.jpg)","src/data/birds/2020-06-11-greenfinch.md","d338d9683751a3f3",{"html":611,"metadata":612},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/greenfinch.jpg\" alt=\"greenfinch\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A warm, humid overcast day today, with a breeze that failed to refresh.

The reeds rustle in the breeze.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A single swift charges over the water; its brethren circle high up in the sky despite the abundant swarms of flies. The sun breaks through the clouds. I am wearing jeans and its cloying warmth is unwelcome.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dozens of slim, electric blue damselflies glide their horizontal bodies out of the way of my strides. They look like graphics from the film Tron. It’s ard to focus on them as they glow and dissipate inches above the grass.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A blue butterly. Purple knapweed. A red-tailed bee.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yellow buttercups, dandelions and ragwort.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And orange brown leaves.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s a day to gaze down into the grass rather than up at the sky.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The swallow of four days ago is absent. A thrush, a robin and a blackbird sing anonymously from the trees, and the same juvenile pied wagtail, adrift from its family, still haunts the water’s edge. Across the water I hear the excitable ululating song of a little grebe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A cloud of white flowers, dog rose I think, encrusts a large shrub, and over towards the railway tracks the ever-thickening bastilles of bramble are also in bloom. We think of them as thorny, aggressive, impenetrable and, later, country kitchen berry-laden, but the pink-white bramble flower is little noticed. They are everywhere these weeks. At the waterworks on monday they were crowded with bees of all kinds humming with honey.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At one edge of the thorny citadel a few birds chatter nervously. The sounds have the clipped roundness of a finch, but I’m unsure which. I see one dart into the open, with what looks like a white-based tail on an otherwise bland faun body. Through binoculars I see that the white is bright yellow and I am looking at a young \u003Cstrong>Greenfinch\u003C/strong>, yet to gain the leaf green plumage that gives them their name.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s followed by another three birds, the bright yellow flash of their tails seeming out of place. Why, if they are drab and camouflaged to protect their young, unworldly bodies, is their most conspicuous adult feature preserved. Other than that they’d be non-descript in the extreme, identifiable only by their silly big heads.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I hope they make it to adulthood. The greenfinch has taken a tumble in recent decades. Formerly one of our commonest birds, changes to farming methods followed by the spread of a deadly virus we can all relate well to mean they are now on the British red list; one of the british species of highest conservation concern. They seem to be doing better locally, after a few particularly lean years. Earlier this spring males circling the Lea Bridge paddocks on undulating, front-heavy aeronautical flights while singing the intro to “Sorted for E’s and Whizz” were a feature of many mornings. And they wheeze their other one note descending song near the wetlands Engine House most days.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the final stretch of my circumnavigation I reach the edge of the mown grass and find a spiny black caterpillar — a peacock butterfly I think — crawling along. I pick it up, throw it deep into the safe zone and walk on, counting the reed warblers as I go.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/brambles.jpg\" alt=\"brambles\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chlorisjuvenilposado.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Main image credit\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":613,"localImagePaths":614,"remoteImagePaths":615,"frontmatter":616,"imagePaths":619},[],[],[],{"layout":27,"primaryTag":605,"tags":617,"title":602,"description":604,"date":618},[493,417,584,521,491,468,443,605],["Date","2020-06-11T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2020-06-14-sedge-warbler",{"id":620,"data":622,"body":630,"filePath":631,"digest":632,"rendered":633},{"title":623,"date":624,"description":625,"primaryTag":466,"tags":626},"61 Boring Birds: #14 Sedge Warbler",["Date","2020-06-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"California girls",[466,584,627,368,495,628,499,629,417,494,440],"Lesser whitethroat","Common tern","Black-headed gull","![sedge warbler](/assets/img/sedge-warbler.jpg)\n\nA mist of midges met me today on my early morning visit. Coronavirus has meant the reserve has been shut, even to permit holders, until 10.30 am, but that has recently been relaxed. It's the first time for several months I've been able to explore it before the birds have a chance to disapear elsewhere. Not that I expect to see anything of any great note, but it's stil nice to experience the calm, empty pathways in the relatively cool, fresh air.\n\nI was greeted, in the same overgrown scrub I mentioned yesterday at the base of Lockwood reservoir, by a cheerfully rattling **Sedge Warbler**. I've not seen one at this spot before and its highly conspicuous, hyperactive displaying hints that it might be a late-arriving male, playing catchup in establishing a territory.\n\nThe superpower of identifying birds by their songs and calls has many mileposts along the route, and distinguishing between sedge and reed warbler songs is something of a rite of passage. They both tend to sing from reedbeds or other damp undergrowth, and deliver a superficially similar series of chuggs, rattles, whirrs and whistles, but are altogether different in mood. \n\nI like to think of the sedge warbler as an overexcited Californian teenager recounting, in leet speak, the story of bumping into a celebrity at the mall, overexcited and running a mile a minute &mdash; \"Ohmigod ohmigod ohmigod, it was like, sooooo, ohmigod ohmigod, but srsly...\". The reed warbler is far more composed, rambling and thinking out loud at a more sedate pace. Like Columbo.\n\nSedge warblers are also more prone to throwing in more musical phrases &mdash; whoop-like whistles and clear one note trills &mdash; though they never form into anything resembling a tune. If you've ever watched a military drummer improvising around the rudiments it's a similar effect &mdash; impressive, virtuosic, but more barnstorming than beautiful. It has something of the [organ grinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVm241fA_Xg) churning out their inane, repetitive gurglings too.\n\nBut this morning's little male charmed me nevertheless. Less skulking than most of its brethren, this one perched on tall sprigs of cow parsley, burdoch and teasel, interspersing these pedestalled performances with short display flights. Unusually grey (I tend to think of them as being a quite warm brown), it stared at me with its fierce cream eyebrows puckered above its shouty beak. \n\nI left it to its unkempt patchwork quilt meadow and climbed up to the reservoir. Pete was out early too and we stood discussing the lack of locally breeding peregrines this year, and listened to a song thrush perched midway up a pylon. It seemed to use the network of metal struts as an amplifier. Or maybe it was the quiet morning atmosphere that made it seem louder.\n\nUp at the top of Lockwood I heard yesterday's lesser whitethroat again, but didn't give chase today. A blackcap sang unconventionally from somewhere in the trees over the fence on Tottenham Marsh and I descended the bank to satisfy myself it wasn't something more unusual doing a convincing blackcap impersonation. A crow sang &mdash; slightly softer, breathier caws &mdash; from another pylon. A tern flew low overhead \"ki-kyaaa\"-ing, and a nearby grasshopper sang in time with the lesser whitethroat and the trill of a wren. I sat down in the grass to enjoy these sounds to make one sit and wait. Black-headed gulls circled high above, catching insects like enoromous, clumsy white-winged swifts, their flight feathers translucent in the sun.\n\nI did not find the blackcap, but walking back I heard another lesser whitethroat &mdash; perhaps they choose to sing in the mornings only &mdash; and saw another sedge warbler fiercely patrolling his little patch of nettles. A pair of goldfinch flew up from the weeds, their bounding flight oscillating erratically like notes on a musical stave. A deep-chested female sparrowhawk pumped its mid-moult wings powerfully a few times and circled back round to the woods, with perhaps more chance of setting eyes on the birds than I had.\n\n![poppy](/assets/img/poppy.jpg)\n\n[Main image credit](https://www.wallpaperflare.com/selective-focus-of-bird-on-flower-animal-france-sparrow-wildlife-wallpaper-gsrdt/download/2560x1600)","src/data/birds/2020-06-14-sedge-warbler.md","f762fbf0ffee14ac",{"html":634,"metadata":635},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/sedge-warbler.jpg\" alt=\"sedge warbler\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A mist of midges met me today on my early morning visit.

Thunder rolls down the valley and the eerily calm water of Lockwood, playing host to seven regal swans, is full of portent. Unseen aquatic mini-beasts make pinprick concentric circles on the surface. It quite literally looks like rain.\n\nThe usual pre-storm birdsong nervously keeps up appearances &mdash; a blackbird, blackcap, chiffchaff and whitethroat &mdash; and the army of canada geese tries its best to put on stiff upper-lipped airs. A handful of gulls perambulate mid-lake, and across the water flies tower in narrow threads, stage rigging for the fake, cut-out trees. \n\nThe play is about to begin.\n\nThe air, tepid and inert up to now, is persuaded to march south and bristles the hairs on my arms as it goes by. Two sand martins battle it, alternately powering through or going with the current, like canoes paddling the rapids. One, then the other, arches its wings into an exaggerated 'v' and glides down to the water &mdash; now ruffled with the wind's children &mdash;, opens its gape and takes a sip. \n\nThe atmosphere has wholly changed. The sky no darker, the sun no less buried, the air equally humid, but it is a different day now. The imminent is now immanent. Waiting for the rain to come, but it is already here somehow. The thunder sounds again and a single swift valiantly gives chase.\n\nAt the top end of the lake ten linnet bounce, twittering away from me, and a number of young **Pied Wagtails** &mdash; I estimate seven &mdash; go about their playful business. In their frivolity they are immune to the clouds of doom blotting out the sun, scampering after flies and playing \"tick\", chasing each other in tight airborne circles. I once saw similar scenes around an almost dry river in the French Pyrenees, cheering my road-weary eyes with their gaiety.\n\nLess comically long-tailed than their [grey cousin](/2020/06/08/grey-wagtail.html), they still have impressive enough tailpieces, though the appearance is that they are wagging the tail rather than the other way around. One of the youngsters is completely tail-less, perhaps after a run-in with a predator. Its cute appearance while on the ground &mdash; a ball of wool with a beak &mdash; becomes slightly disturbing as it takes to the wing. Tense, I half expect it to tumble over and over itself and plunge into the water. Maybe I spent too much time playing Angry Birds.\n\nAlong the back end of the reservoir the show goes on, oblivious to the gathering storm. The linnet flit hither and thither, and a flock of Starling &mdash; growing to around 40 birds by the time I leave &mdash; alternately envelops the summit of the water tower and several patches of shoreline. The pied wagtails have followed me too, and that lesser whitethroat still sings provocatively from the scrub.\n\nMy dry luck has held out this long and I choose not to tempt fate, stepping up the pace on the return leg. The starlings are content to stay guarding the tower, the linnet eventually grow wise to the fact they cannot outrun me, and so outflank me instead and return to feed in the weeds behind my back. But the wagtails keep me company all the way.\n\nI assume there must be several newly fledged families around. Most of the birds are very young. At least one is still white and fluffy on the head, like a teddy bear, and all their faces have the unfinished look of an old master's sketch hanging in a museum. I wonder I havent seen any responsible adults. Eventually I do see one female and one male, though I don't envy their childcare arrangements.\n\nIf you asked me to describe a pied wagtail &mdash; which, in a sense, by reading this, you are &mdash; I would say it's a small, long-tailed black and white bird, neatly tailored like a duke in evening dress.\n\nBut recently, with the added attention I've been giving the commoner species, I've begun to notice something &mdash; they are really quite untidy looking things. The species on the whole, known in most countries as the White Wagtail, is far cleaner cut, silver or iron jacketed, black-hatted and with a clean white shirt on beneath. From Iceland to Turkey this dandy steps out on the town.\n\nBut for some unknown reason, Britain and Ireland have our own resident subspecies. Darker on top, close inspection reveals it's far from a beautiful gloss black, more like lead or low-grade coal.

Thunder rolls down the valley and the eerily calm water of Lockwood, playing host to seven regal swans, is full of portent. Unseen aquatic mini-beasts make pinprick concentric circles on the surface. It quite literally looks like rain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The usual pre-storm birdsong nervously keeps up appearances — a blackbird, blackcap, chiffchaff and whitethroat — and the army of canada geese tries its best to put on stiff upper-lipped airs. A handful of gulls perambulate mid-lake, and across the water flies tower in narrow threads, stage rigging for the fake, cut-out trees.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The play is about to begin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The air, tepid and inert up to now, is persuaded to march south and bristles the hairs on my arms as it goes by. Two sand martins battle it, alternately powering through or going with the current, like canoes paddling the rapids. One, then the other, arches its wings into an exaggerated ‘v’ and glides down to the water — now ruffled with the wind’s children —, opens its gape and takes a sip.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The atmosphere has wholly changed. The sky no darker, the sun no less buried, the air equally humid, but it is a different day now. The imminent is now immanent. Waiting for the rain to come, but it is already here somehow. The thunder sounds again and a single swift valiantly gives chase.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the top end of the lake ten linnet bounce, twittering away from me, and a number of young \u003Cstrong>Pied Wagtails\u003C/strong> — I estimate seven — go about their playful business. In their frivolity they are immune to the clouds of doom blotting out the sun, scampering after flies and playing “tick”, chasing each other in tight airborne circles. I once saw similar scenes around an almost dry river in the French Pyrenees, cheering my road-weary eyes with their gaiety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Less comically long-tailed than their \u003Ca href=\"/2020/06/08/grey-wagtail.html\">grey cousin\u003C/a>, they still have impressive enough tailpieces, though the appearance is that they are wagging the tail rather than the other way around. One of the youngsters is completely tail-less, perhaps after a run-in with a predator. Its cute appearance while on the ground — a ball of wool with a beak — becomes slightly disturbing as it takes to the wing. Tense, I half expect it to tumble over and over itself and plunge into the water. Maybe I spent too much time playing Angry Birds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Along the back end of the reservoir the show goes on, oblivious to the gathering storm. The linnet flit hither and thither, and a flock of Starling — growing to around 40 birds by the time I leave — alternately envelops the summit of the water tower and several patches of shoreline. The pied wagtails have followed me too, and that lesser whitethroat still sings provocatively from the scrub.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My dry luck has held out this long and I choose not to tempt fate, stepping up the pace on the return leg. The starlings are content to stay guarding the tower, the linnet eventually grow wise to the fact they cannot outrun me, and so outflank me instead and return to feed in the weeds behind my back. But the wagtails keep me company all the way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I assume there must be several newly fledged families around. Most of the birds are very young. At least one is still white and fluffy on the head, like a teddy bear, and all their faces have the unfinished look of an old master’s sketch hanging in a museum. I wonder I havent seen any responsible adults. Eventually I do see one female and one male, though I don’t envy their childcare arrangements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you asked me to describe a pied wagtail — which, in a sense, by reading this, you are — I would say it’s a small, long-tailed black and white bird, neatly tailored like a duke in evening dress.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But recently, with the added attention I’ve been giving the commoner species, I’ve begun to notice something — they are really quite untidy looking things. The species on the whole, known in most countries as the White Wagtail, is far cleaner cut, silver or iron jacketed, black-hatted and with a clean white shirt on beneath. From Iceland to Turkey this dandy steps out on the town.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But for some unknown reason, Britain and Ireland have our own resident subspecies. Darker on top, close inspection reveals it’s far from a beautiful gloss black, more like lead or low-grade coal. And the seams between the various pieces of the outfit are messy, colouring over the edges.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Without wishing to sound jingoistic, I doubt there’s a better avian example of the plucky little Brit.

A morning of full rain, and later merely the empty threat of it. By the time I left the house at about 4 the sun scampered in and out when opportunity allowed, like a mouse raiding a crumb-laden kitchen.\n\nI'd been at the reservoirs for upwards of an hour and was sat in front of a bush [waiting again](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2020/06/16/reed-warbler.html). The timorous sun had breathed enough warmth to give the grass some superficial dryness, but on sitting I was plagued by the trick nature likes to play &mdash; dry grass, wet arse.\n\nStill, it was quite pleasant to sit on the banks of West Warwick, next to the railway line and looking out onto the north-easternmost corner of the marshes. The wet morning had compressed all human activity into the afternoon, and cyclists, joggers, layabouts on benches &mdash; and at least two dogs judging by the alarmingly vicious fight I could hear &mdash; enjoyed the intermittent early evening glow.\n\nI was waiting for a **Lesser Whitethroat** to emerge. I'd heard it faintly from the other side of the tracks and had eventually pinpointed it to... somewhere in those bushes.\n\nWhile waiting, I mulled over the highlights of the day so far. Which would make it into the blog if I _didn't_ have any success here?\n\nWhile the walk was, strictly speaking, a continuum, with no boundaries, just one footfall after another, its' hard not to see it as episodic. As with any aspect of life. And each episode had its defining moments and birds. Some episodes built around the bird, and others pushing one forward as their candidate for a leading role in my story.\n\nThe first episodes are intertwined, the second taking a chunk out of the middle of the first.\n\n> At the top corner of No. 5 three juvenile pied wagtails entertained me with the same nervy cheekiness as the [previous day](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2020/06/17/pied-wagtail.html). Swifts and house martins wheeled over the filter beds, their movements harmonious as though they were playing some unhearable tune together on the strings of the air. A finch with a flash of red on its flank &mdash; Bullfinch? &mdash; drew me to...\n\n> ... Behind Coppermill Tower is a grassy knoll of such serenity it coudl be the rustic corner of some Capability Brown garden. I'd never stepped up here before, but the tempting thought of a Bullfinch (I later concluded must be a chaffinch) drew me on. But for the sound of a chainsaw &mdash; valiantly resisted by a blackcap &mdash; I could have stayed much longer. A mainsail of flies billowed just out of reach of the tall trees, and up in their finest canopy twigs I finally laid eyes on one of the goldcrests that have been singing so persistently lately. Tiny as can be, with large heads split at the top by a volcanic fissure of flame yellow feathers, they display the inventiveness in animal design God normally reserves for sea creatures. \n\n> ... Back at the water the numbers of young wagtails had swelled to double the original number. They must be having such fun in their pre-school with all their new friends. Overhead a swallow drifted north. Surely, they are breeding somewhere around here this year.\n\nGoldcrest, swallow and pied wagtail... two already written about, which leaves goldcrest as today's bird of record. But, like a poker player, its' out of position, showed its hand too soon.\n\n> Taking the long route around the back of No. 4, and walking into the sun, a female sparrowhawk glided into view. Backlit by the sun, its translucent wing tips showed the bars on its fingers as bold as cygnet rings. Gliding south it untucked its spindly legs momentarily and emptied its bowels into the drinking water below. I watched its procession across the sky, climbing imperceptibly on the breeze in steps, almost stalling, perhaps yawing about one wingtip, then flapping mechanically a few times for enough speed to repeat the process. \n\n> It made its way into the distant storm of swifts. They seemed unalarmed, with no fear of this pathetic excuse for a predator, impotent where speed, not stealth, is the name of the game. The hawk banked and glided steeply downwards behind some trees. I did not see the outcome.\n\nSparrowhawk, seen well, and drawing me into its world somewhat. A strong contender, and no mistake, but somehow does not move me. Could it be that I don't actually like the bird that much?\n\n> Returning to the main public path I came across a young birdwatcher and his father, bothe pushing their bikes and the youngster pausing every now and then to investigate some forms perched on a distant branch overhanging the water. A little later I caome across some youths fishing, using the three-rods-on-a-stand setup that seems popular. One of them has his back to the others and stares through a pair of binoculars too. As I walk away I overhear his friend say, \"You look like a right pervert with them binoculars, you know that\"\n\n> In both of these I see my younger self. A love for nature nurtured by a father who died to young, and the cruel teasing that the hobby too often inspires. I wish it were with disbelief that I could look back on the secretive way I carried out the hobby in my teens, with not even my closest friends being aware that my greatest love was for birds of the feathered kind. Maybe this is why it's still such a personal, private experience. Only in recent years have I fully shaken off the stigma\n\n> The comedian Daniel Kitson delivered a crushing joke at one of his shows a few years ago, demonically suggesting the audience look to their left and right and ask themselves if the friends they were with were just the _people they'd ended up knowing_. Somehow, when I was younger, I never once thought that maybe the people I'd ended up knowing were wrong about the world.\n\n> Walking on, I came across a family of stout-billed blackcap probing the leaves for insects. So nice to see them so well even in the leafy season. A little further along two zebra-headed great crested grebe chicks innocently cornered a balck-headed gull, who promptly flew away.\n\nThe blackcap has [already featured](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2020/06/09/blackcap.html), and the grebes were cute, but I feel they have better performances to come.\n\n> At the coppermill stream a family of coot were about as entertaining as they can be. Five crimson-headed cootlets swam as one like a many-headed hydra, and one of the attentive parents repeatedly picked a yellowish ball of some sort &mdash; a nut? &mdash; from the depths, only to be dropped by the chick who could, unsurprisingly, do nothing with this morsel that its head woudl almost fit inside.\n\nMaybe it's the coot's day? One of them has to be.\n\n> Back at East Warwick's water's edge I watched a young, stumpy-tailed grey wagtail, with the pale pink legs I only this afternoon realised are diagnostic, mince along the strandline of mushy green algae. \n\nExceedingly tame, this one lit the fires of joy in me more than any other bird today, but its time has [been and gone](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2020/06/08/grey-wagtail.html)\n\n> Round the back of the reservoir a fox scarpered across the railway line, chased by a pair of scolding sedge warblers. A singing goldfinch in a bush, a green greenfinch, heavy-headed as Nick Cave, on the overhead wires, and a small flock of daytripping starlings cought my eye too. The reed beds sound excited to see me again but it is, of course, only the reed warblers. One of them nips off a feathery seedhead and carries it back to the nest.\n\nMemories the afternoon's sights and sounds to pass the time while waiting.\n\nWaiting. \n\nFor the lesser whitethroat to appear.\n\nFor almost an hour.\n\nA lesser black-backed and a black-headed gull united to taunt me with the same \"ca-ca-caaaah\" calls. Blackcaps and whitethroats &mdash; both close relatives &mdash; were out in force, feeding and singing in the open and doing their utmost to raise then dash my hopes.\n\nBut the bird I hoped for did not show. After twenty minutes it even stopped singing.\n\nWorse, a few brief glimpses of things that _may_ have been it, but not clear enough to be sure. A fate far worse than definitely _not_ seeing it. \n\nThe torture of birdwatching. My love, my life, my agony.\n\nTo which this post will stand as a memorial.\n\n![empty sky](/assets/img/empty-sky.jpg)\n\n[Main image credit](https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/5138410)","src/data/birds/2020-06-18-lesser-whitethroat.md","1a00c26951250d29",{"html":813,"metadata":814},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/lesser-whitethroat.jpg\" alt=\"lesser whitethroat\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another day of bully-boy rain clouds intimidating the skies above London.

A little grebe floats close by the breeding platform and ask itself if the, admitedly, sublime location of the property outweighs the downside of having such terrible birds as neighbours.\n\nAround reservoirs 4 and 5 a pair of terns and an adult and juvenile grey heron take it in turns to hop, skip and jump around my pilgrimage. At one point, both herons are poised with dagger-bills at the ready above an area of green slime &mdash; who knows what fish, or other aquatic meal (they will eat frogs, voles, ducklings...) cowers beneath.

You'd half expect it to pull a marine chronometer from its waistcoat pocket.\n\nNearing the end of my sojourn, I hear an insignificant rambling warble emanating from one of the trackside trees. Stepping closer I see a **Wren**. Normally so strident voiced, this one is crouched in the shade and intermittently talking to itself, sounding like a hesitant dunnock.

I've recently read a lot about this phenomena in birds &mdash; with the exception of a great many in Europe and North America, both sexes sing in most species the world over, with duets a common pattern. As the [female bird song website](http://femalebirdsong.org/) features a picture of a wren, it seems likely that the females do sing, but finding details of what it sounds like is easier said than done. \n\nBut for now it is, at least, a nice theory. _[update - [it's a juvenile](https://www.xeno-canto.org/191011)]_\n\nIn the last trees before crossing back over the stream I stand watching around twenty long-tailed tits baubling about. A tall man with a stoop, kind sleepy eyes and a greying mustache approaches. \"You like looking at the birds, yeah?\". I lower my binoculars and acknowledge him. \n\n\"What have you see?\" he asks.\n\nI tell him about the lapwings &mdash; technically the birdwatching highlight of the morning &mdash; but after a little while I realise I misunderstood the intent behind the question; he is a fisherman, not a birdwatcher. I raise my eyes upwards to the green canopy above us.\n\n\"And there's a bunch of long-tailed tits up in the tree,\" I say. \"And I found an egg.\" I show him the speckled, pointed, empty egg I found on the ground, and he guesses it is that of a duck.\n\n\"Ah very nice... did you see the pelicans the other day.\" \n\n\"Do you mean the spoonbills...\"\n\nHis eyes twinkle &mdash; he thinks this is a hilarious joke. In different times, he would be hitting me on the shoulder with disarming overfamiliarity.\n\n\"Ah, I am joking. There is no pelicans. But, you know, I am from the Danube delta, where I worked as a guide &mdash; a fishing guide &mdash; and there we get such pelicans all the time.\"\n\nI've heard of the Danube delta in Romania. It's famed as a breeding and wintering ground for wetland birds, both secluded rarities, and spectacles of thousands upon thousands of the commoner sorts. \n\n\"Tell me,\" he continues, \"what is the little one &mdash; it is so very little &mdash; with his tail it goes like this,\" &mdash; he mimes a rapid see-sawing with his fingers &mdash; \"And there is always two of them. There is always two.\"\n\n\"Does it have yellow on it?\"\n\n\"Yes, very yellow, yes.\"\n\n\"That's a grey wagtail,\" I tell him.\n\n\"What they eat?\"\n\nHe nods earnestly as I confirm his suspicions that they are fly eaters, but &mdash; like an overgrown five year old &mdash; changes the subject quickly when I try to educate him how to identify the different wagtail species.\n\n\"The egyptian geese,\" he interrupts, taking a step back, \"why do they stand like this?\" His feet are firmly planted wide apart on the floor, and he looks at me with the imploring eyes of an Italian lover. I tell him I don't know, but show I appreciate his point by contributing my own little am-dram interpretation of their posture, puffing out my chest and stretching out my neck.\n\n\"And they are so aggressive! Why are they so aggressive? I think it is... I always see them with so many little chicks, but then I see them with maybe only one. Where do they go? Who takes them? Bloody foxes! This place is swarming with foxes.\"\n\nI tell him that the gulls are another top predator of baby waterfowl. \"Gulls\" he rejoinders, \" &mdash; I hate them!\".\n\n\"And what are the cormorants doing here?\" he bemoans. \"This is not natural. They are seabirds. They should be on the sea.\"\n\nI tell him that there are two basic types, and the continental form _is_ more commonly found on inland waterways.\n\n\"Pfft,\" he protests, \"but they eat trout their own size &mdash; I see them. I put a wizzal on the island.\"\n\n\"A wizzal?\"\n\n\"Yes a wizzal. You know, like this.\" He acts out a last mime.\n\n\"Oh - a weasel!\"\n\n\"Yes, wizzel. I will put one on the island, and then no more cormorant. You will see.\"\n\nHe has been slowly withdrawing from me, but with such rogueish bonhommie I did not even notice. As we part company I playfully tell him I'll report him for the weaseling.\n\n\"It was not me,\" he laughs. \"It was a Irishman!\"\n\n[Main image credit](https://www.pikist.com/free-photo-smpws)","src/data/birds/2020-06-25-wren.md","f3630ecca35475ac",{"html":945,"metadata":946},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/wren.jpg\" alt=\"wren\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Today I finally commit fully to a proper early morning visit to the reserve, setting my alarm for 7am, and managing to get out the door by 7.30.

Stepping closer I see a \u003Cstrong>Wren\u003C/strong>. Normally so strident voiced, this one is crouched in the shade and intermittently talking to itself, sounding like a hesitant dunnock.

I’ve recently read a lot about this phenomena in birds — with the exception of a great many in Europe and North America, both sexes sing in most species the world over, with duets a common pattern. As the \u003Ca href=\"http://femalebirdsong.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">female bird song website\u003C/a> features a picture of a wren, it seems likely that the females do sing, but finding details of what it sounds like is easier said than done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But for now it is, at least, a nice theory. \u003Cem>[update - \u003Ca href=\"https://www.xeno-canto.org/191011\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">it’s a juvenile\u003C/a>]\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the last trees before crossing back over the stream I stand watching around twenty long-tailed tits baubling about. A tall man with a stoop, kind sleepy eyes and a greying mustache approaches. “You like looking at the birds, yeah?”. I lower my binoculars and acknowledge him.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“What have you see?” he asks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I tell him about the lapwings — technically the birdwatching highlight of the morning — but after a little while I realise I misunderstood the intent behind the question; he is a fisherman, not a birdwatcher.

I tell him I don’t know, but show I appreciate his point by contributing my own little am-dram interpretation of their posture, puffing out my chest and stretching out my neck.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“And they are so aggressive! Why are they so aggressive? I think it is… I always see them with so many little chicks, but then I see them with maybe only one. Where do they go? Who takes them? Bloody foxes!

Not much of a bike ride, but the heavy smattering of rain in its opening stages drew a refreshed smile to my cheeks. The weather really can't make up its mind. Before the end of my short jaunt around the wetlands and marshes the puddles were almost evaporated away by the searing sun, throwing up an almost palpable, knee-high mist that felt warm and clammy, like the entrance to a Turkish Hammam.\n\nThe shower hadn't brought anything interesting down with it and the birdlife was in much the same mood as it had been in the wind-buffeted early morning. At 8am the islands were laden with birds waiting for the water to become less choppy. Coots on East Warwick island, cormorants on No. 5, and an incredible 15 mute swan sheltering under the trees of one of High Maynard's two islands. Even the gulls, who normally dot the surface of Lockwood on any day, were notably absent.

It loomed so large and distorted the senses such that most birds seemed smaller and more pathetic than usual. This applied all the way from the fishing parties of cormorants striking out up the valley, down to the sand martins, goldfinches and blue tits who struggled onwards through a landscape made epic by constant motion; Lawrence struggling through a sandstorm, or Scott in the Antarctic. \n\nThe only birds immune to this effect were the swifts themselves, magnified in size by their total mastery of the wild stallion air, and, curiously, the group of around 25 **Linnets** dancing between the skyline and the weeds. They've had a good breeding season it would seem, and their numbers are really starting to swell compared to the twos or threes I was seeing earlier this spring.\n\nYou've seen a linnet, I guarantee it, though you may not realise it. They're particularly common near the coast. If you've ever seen a flock of small, grey and brown birds flying bouncily ahead as you walk a coastal path, they'll be linnets. In Cornwall they're particularly numerous and last year I saw flocks of well over a hunderd as I walked the south coast trail.\n\nYou'll also find them on farmland, moorland, and anywhere there's any open ground with plenty seed bearing plants... which is basically everywhere apart from towns and cities, woodland and mountain tops. I'm a member of a facebook group that identifies photos of birds posted by strangers and, along with meadow pipit and dunnock, linnet is the most oft-papped bird. \n\nBack in the Victorian era I imagine they'd've been a more recognisable name, though not for good reasons. Back then, catching and caging wild finches was a popular route to getting a pet and, along with chaffinches, bullfinches and goldfinches, linnets were popular catches (I learned all this from the wonderful book [A sweet, wild note](https://wordery.com/a-sweet-wild-note-richard-smyth-9781783963140)). \n\nLinnets are not exactly beautiful singers. I've already described their songs in this blog as \"twinkling\", \"twittering\", \"music-box chatter\" and \"a medley of playground taunts (but perhaps sweeter)\". Today the male who pauses for a moment to sing atop a particularly tall weed reminds me of nursery school children playing space invaders, improvised laser gun noises interspersed with high pitched, excitable squeals.\n\nNo, not beautiful, or melodic, but always high-spirited... which is perhaps the perverse goal of keeping a caged bird in one's living room.\n\nThey're also marginally less well-presented than most of our other finches, whose plumages feature the large, bright, bold areas of primary colours of a Rousseau or a Gauguin painting. Linnets, however, are more rustic in appearance, with the brush strokes plainly visible and the colours overlapping each other in streaks. The male has a reddish pink flush each side of his chest and on his forehead, bleeding into a grey head, streaked cream underparts, and chestnut back and wings complete the ensemble. The female is the same, only streakier and without the magenta. Watching one close up recently I noticed she had the long-lashed eyes of a traditional rocking horse.\n\nIs it me, or is this writing more lacklustre than usual? It certainly feels like I'm just going through the motions of describing a bird rather than conveying what it feels like to see one. I was going to continue writing about the stock dove I saw on this afternoon's bike ride. It was it that stirred me enough to want to write, but the lethargic haze is back.

I avoided the morning's downpours through a savy combination of sleeping in and DIY, but this did mean missing out on the **Curlew** that Daniel had seen struggling south through the rain.\n\nFinding unusual birds during periods of heavy rain [has pedigree](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2020/06/03/starling.html), but also requires determination and willpower on behalf of the birdwatcher. Especially given that all too often the only rewards are the exercise, a thoroughly clean pair of shoes and &mdash; if you're in the right mood to appreciate it &mdash; a freshening of the spirit.\n\nOver the last year my lot has been to receive those prosaic rewards without the trophy of a rare bird dropping in, with a couple of notable exceptions. Last spring I caught a gloriously suave black tern before it evaporated north (though this was originally found by somebody else, and was less a reward for than the root cause of my soaking), and this May I found a flock of seven whimbrel, the curlew's smaller cousin, battling their way against a bodyweight-supporting, sleet throwing northern gale.\n\nBut by and large I am mostly just grateful that I am the type that enjoys the bracing weather.\n\nBy the time I headed out today the rain had well and truly come to a close, leaving behind the strongest winds for weeks (or months?) to ruffle feathers and bend trees. Over coppermill lane hundreds of swifts and martins hurtled along on its particle accelerator force fields. While they appear dare devil in their speed, I think I know why they come down so low on days like these; even for them the pace is too hot to handle high up in the sky when the tempest is in town.\n\nSand martins and terns struggle to make any headway propelling themselves south over East Warwick, but seem to enjoy turning and letting the wind send them, in just a few seconds, the full length of the lake. Around the back of No. 5 the [common sandpiper is still there](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2020/06/23/common-sandpiper.html), joined today by two terns floating along, taking turns to dip down to the surface and wet their beaks.\n\nI also see a pair of mistle thrushes, the first I've seen here since the blog began. Easily the least attractive of our thrushes, they manage to look untidy even when every feather is precisely in its place. Their heads look as if they've been made from papier mache, left at the strips-of-newspaper stage before the paint goes on. I think one of them is a juvenile as it appears to be mid-moult; little fresh feathers, like scales or arrows, poke out between the grey-brown base coat and, for a change, it looks as if it has made an effort. It'll wear off soon I expect. One of them carries a grub or two in its beak and as I approach they both fly off, rattling in alarm as they go.\n\nI have nothing calling me urgently home &mdash; waiting for the glue to dry and the washing machine to finish &mdash; so continue onto the north side of the reserve. In the overgrown waterside willows next to the car park at least one family of blue tits, stained pale yellow with youth, bustles along from tree to tree. In the winter I waited here for hours on end in search of the firecrests that spent the winter. As autumn progresses this warbler-friendly avenue will become a more regular haunt but for today it's merely a pleasant, low-key intermission.\n\nOn High Maynard the tufted ducks are beginning to gather in rafts to moult. By late summer these elegant, black and white ducks will number in their thousands. Today they bob up and down on their pint-sized sea as it tries to throw them of. Ducklings and cootlets take refuge in the wind shadow of an island. A pair of gadwall plummet out of the sky and glide magnificently on the breeze to a dramatic splashdown finale. It's like watching the ski jumping on the telly. \n\nAt the back of the industrial estate a couple of sizeable willow trees, united by their foliage, billow green and turn sea monster; slowly they swallow the stockyard whole. As I approach canada geese and their tweenage goslings run, showing only their heads and necks above the thick bed of knapweed, to the safety of the water. The few lesser black-backed gulls overhead chatter to one another with the economical verbiage of an Alan Bennett play:\n\n> \"chup chup?\"\n\n> \"chup chup\"\n\n> \"chup?\"\n\n> \"Yeaow!\"\n\nWith dark clouds accelerating behind, and some well-placed sunbeams picking them out individually, they are the opposite of silhouettes. They hang in the breeze like the finely drawn main characters against the out of focus, layered background of a classic Disney film.\n\nOn the far side of Lockwood, within view of Tottenham's football ground, I pause to record a birthday message for my football fan friend. The wind here is as bracing as anywhere on the reserve and the microphone, at times, picks up little more than the wind's distorted huffs and puffs. Finishing the recording I pick up my binoculars again and focus in on a blue plastic bag travelling north on the wind. It'd be a beautiful sight were it easier to dismiss its primary function of being litter.\n\nBut I do have it to thank for pointing my eyes in the right direction at the right time. Another curlew hauled itself laboriously south against the wind, keeping close to the water surface and looking fairly unremarkable, like an immature gull. Largely the same brown colour as dead and rotting vegetation, the curlew's dedication to camouflage severely diminished its visual allure, and its plumage is dull to look at even by well-camouflaged birds' standards.\n\nBut this is not why I &mdash; and many others &mdash; love the curlew.\n\nThe one I saw today had a relatively short bill, hinting that it was probably a male (or, fingers crossed, a young bird, althoug that would be very early to fledge). Even this specimen had a beak several times longer than its head, with a pleasant downward curve, like Gonzo from The Muppets' sophisticated French cousin. A common sight in my childhood, we would watch them probing the mud, seaweed or turf of many a wide, Welsh expanse. One place in particular, a beach midway between [Beaumaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumaris) and [Penmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penmon), was always home to a few birds engaged in a stately search for worms as the tide tried to rush them. Once, we saw porpoises too.\n\nDespite their size &mdash; the largest british wader, almost as big as a goose &mdash; their cryptic plumage means they are hard to see. But they are rarely difficult to find due to their hauntingly beautiful songs and calls. The call that gives them their name &mdash; an [uileann pipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n9VVZS6TLY)-like \"currr-lee\" &mdash; is how I'd want to be called if I were a dog. It is, more or less, how Mrs. Irons &mdash; the proprietor of the self-catering cottage we used to frequent each year on Anglesey &mdash; used to call her eldest border collie, Chips. How intricate and pretty a tapestry our memories weave.\n\nOn the hillsides and moors around Wrexham, where I grew up, these calls were commonplace. And at [Point of Ayr](https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/dee-estuary-point-of-ayr/) on the Dee estuary in winter they'd mingle with the calls of oystercatchers, redshanks and shelducks as they abandoned the mudflats ahead of the rising tide, and gathered in their thousands to roost. \n\nInterspersed with the calls there would always be a few songs, as beautiful a sound as you will hear in nature. Whistles break up and burble, with the voices of many birds layered on top of one another making the air shimmer with sound. \n\n\u003Caudio controls>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/curlew.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\u003C/audio>\n\nWhen I was eight years old my party trick was to hold some saliva in my mouth while I whistled, imitating their sound. I got a gold star for it in class.

I avoided the morning’s downpours through a savy combination of sleeping in and DIY, but this did mean missing out on the \u003Cstrong>Curlew\u003C/strong> that Daniel had seen struggling south through the rain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finding unusual birds during periods of heavy rain \u003Ca href=\"http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2020/06/03/starling.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">has pedigree\u003C/a>, but also requires determination and willpower on behalf of the birdwatcher. Especially given that all too often the only rewards are the exercise, a thoroughly clean pair of shoes and — if you’re in the right mood to appreciate it — a freshening of the spirit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Over the last year my lot has been to receive those prosaic rewards without the trophy of a rare bird dropping in, with a couple of notable exceptions. Last spring I caught a gloriously suave black tern before it evaporated north (though this was originally found by somebody else, and was less a reward for than the root cause of my soaking), and this May I found a flock of seven whimbrel, the curlew’s smaller cousin, battling their way against a bodyweight-supporting, sleet throwing northern gale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But by and large I am mostly just grateful that I am the type that enjoys the bracing weather.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By the time I headed out today the rain had well and truly come to a close, leaving behind the strongest winds for weeks (or months?) to ruffle feathers and bend trees. Over coppermill lane hundreds of swifts and martins hurtled along on its particle accelerator force fields. While they appear dare devil in their speed, I think I know why they come down so low on days like these; even for them the pace is too hot to handle high up in the sky when the tempest is in town.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sand martins and terns struggle to make any headway propelling themselves south over East Warwick, but seem to enjoy turning and letting the wind send them, in just a few seconds, the full length of the lake. Around the back of No. 5 the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2020/06/23/common-sandpiper.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">common sandpiper is still there\u003C/a>, joined today by two terns floating along, taking turns to dip down to the surface and wet their beaks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also see a pair of mistle thrushes, the first I’ve seen here since the blog began. Easily the least attractive of our thrushes, they manage to look untidy even when every feather is precisely in its place. Their heads look as if they’ve been made from papier mache, left at the strips-of-newspaper stage before the paint goes on. I think one of them is a juvenile as it appears to be mid-moult; little fresh feathers, like scales or arrows, poke out between the grey-brown base coat and, for a change, it looks as if it has made an effort. It’ll wear off soon I expect. One of them carries a grub or two in its beak and as I approach they both fly off, rattling in alarm as they go.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have nothing calling me urgently home — waiting for the glue to dry and the washing machine to finish — so continue onto the north side of the reserve. In the overgrown waterside willows next to the car park at least one family of blue tits, stained pale yellow with youth, bustles along from tree to tree. In the winter I waited here for hours on end in search of the firecrests that spent the winter. As autumn progresses this warbler-friendly avenue will become a more regular haunt but for today it’s merely a pleasant, low-key intermission.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On High Maynard the tufted ducks are beginning to gather in rafts to moult. By late summer these elegant, black and white ducks will number in their thousands. Today they bob up and down on their pint-sized sea as it tries to throw them of. Ducklings and cootlets take refuge in the wind shadow of an island. A pair of gadwall plummet out of the sky and glide magnificently on the breeze to a dramatic splashdown finale. It’s like watching the ski jumping on the telly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the back of the industrial estate a couple of sizeable willow trees, united by their foliage, billow green and turn sea monster; slowly they swallow the stockyard whole. As I approach canada geese and their tweenage goslings run, showing only their heads and necks above the thick bed of knapweed, to the safety of the water. The few lesser black-backed gulls overhead chatter to one another with the economical verbiage of an Alan Bennett play:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“chup chup?”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“chup chup”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“chup?”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Yeaow!”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>With dark clouds accelerating behind, and some well-placed sunbeams picking them out individually, they are the opposite of silhouettes. They hang in the breeze like the finely drawn main characters against the out of focus, layered background of a classic Disney film.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the far side of Lockwood, within view of Tottenham’s football ground, I pause to record a birthday message for my football fan friend. The wind here is as bracing as anywhere on the reserve and the microphone, at times, picks up little more than the wind’s distorted huffs and puffs. Finishing the recording I pick up my binoculars again and focus in on a blue plastic bag travelling north on the wind. It’d be a beautiful sight were it easier to dismiss its primary function of being litter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But I do have it to thank for pointing my eyes in the right direction at the right time. Another curlew hauled itself laboriously south against the wind, keeping close to the water surface and looking fairly unremarkable, like an immature gull. Largely the same brown colour as dead and rotting vegetation, the curlew’s dedication to camouflage severely diminished its visual allure, and its plumage is dull to look at even by well-camouflaged birds’ standards.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But this is not why I — and many others — love the curlew.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The one I saw today had a relatively short bill, hinting that it was probably a male (or, fingers crossed, a young bird, althoug that would be very early to fledge). Even this specimen had a beak several times longer than its head, with a pleasant downward curve, like Gonzo from The Muppets’ sophisticated French cousin. A common sight in my childhood, we would watch them probing the mud, seaweed or turf of many a wide, Welsh expanse. One place in particular, a beach midway between \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumaris\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Beaumaris\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penmon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Penmon\u003C/a>, was always home to a few birds engaged in a stately search for worms as the tide tried to rush them. Once, we saw porpoises too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Despite their size — the largest british wader, almost as big as a goose — their cryptic plumage means they are hard to see. But they are rarely difficult to find due to their hauntingly beautiful songs and calls. The call that gives them their name — an \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n9VVZS6TLY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">uileann pipe\u003C/a>-like “currr-lee” — is how I’d want to be called if I were a dog. It is, more or less, how Mrs. Irons — the proprietor of the self-catering cottage we used to frequent each year on Anglesey — used to call her eldest border collie, Chips. How intricate and pretty a tapestry our memories weave.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the hillsides and moors around Wrexham, where I grew up, these calls were commonplace. And at \u003Ca href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/dee-estuary-point-of-ayr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Point of Ayr\u003C/a> on the Dee estuary in winter they’d mingle with the calls of oystercatchers, redshanks and shelducks as they abandoned the mudflats ahead of the rising tide, and gathered in their thousands to roost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interspersed with the calls there would always be a few songs, as beautiful a sound as you will hear in nature. Whistles break up and burble, with the voices of many birds layered on top of one another making the air shimmer with sound.\u003C/p>\n\u003Caudio controls>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/curlew.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\u003C/audio>\n\u003Cp>When I was eight years old my party trick was to hold some saliva in my mouth while I whistled, imitating their sound.

Rumaging between the buttons of my not too warm jacket and slapping my cheek with a bony palm. Throwing swifts like knives, drawing gasps from the audience of my giddy face. Wowing and winnowing the morning according to its whims.\n\nA jay with a big, uncouth mouth shouts out of the bushes while young blackcaps noodle on their syrinxes in search of a voice. The long-tailed tits are at it again &mdash; they always are &mdash; and dangle from the trees like Fagin's gang of ruffians. A pied wagtail attempts to spoon-feed flies to its two children, but a belly-fluff young crow stomps boisterously between them, scaring them off in its atempt to play.\n\nAt the fisherman's hut, in all the trees' shelters, the air behaves and lets the breath catch up. A juvenile robin is midway through its moult. Soon it will be all grown up, but for now the splash of red leaking from its brown breast makes it look as though it's been shot. A chiffchaff rushes snatches of song out of the treetops and they are packaged &mdash; \"29 Jun 2020, 8:00 AM, Walthamstow - Unusual double speed chiffchaff song\" &mdash; in my ears for later listening. A green woodpecker half-yaffles &mdash; yaffs, I suppose &mdash; unseen in the wooded neck of land. The colonies on the island are noisy enough though.\n\nBy the outflow pipe, on the underwater sandbank it propagates, stands a **Grey Heron**. It's a beauty, proud and balletic, a bird of the regency period. It's crotch-deep in the water, but each slow, poised pace it takes does not soak or splash a single feather. Its pronounced black eyebrow &mdash; very _a la mode_ &mdash; extends behind the eye in a mulleted mohican, and thick black stitching perforates the white cravat of its strong, angular neck.\n\nBut best of all are the lace-like plumes that descend from its throat and also lie draped across its back. Superlatively delicate and infinitely tasteful. Lakeside haute-couture at its best. \n\nWhenever my mum sees a heron she will comment on how big it looks. Perhaps they _are_ getting bigger. This one looks as powerful as any I've seen. But also nervous. Unlike those in Holland &mdash; which strut about Amsterdam almost as tame as pigeons &mdash; British herons are cautious around humans. They tense their bodies and draw the suggestion of a flight-ready S-bend in their necks as soon as a human approaches, planning their departure well in advance.\n\nI edge as close as I dare. I notice that the black smudges against the sandy bottom of the lake are not, as I had thought, clumps of water weed. They are the plodding bodies of the giant carp that roam the waterways like trainee manatees. Too big a mouthful for the heron, they swim slowly and safely despite its shadow. They are, I imagine, big enough to have achieved invincibility in our sterile, bear-less country.\n\nA grebe swims next to them, just beneath the surface.

Wowing and winnowing the morning according to its whims.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A jay with a big, uncouth mouth shouts out of the bushes while young blackcaps noodle on their syrinxes in search of a voice. The long-tailed tits are at it again — they always are — and dangle from the trees like Fagin’s gang of ruffians. A pied wagtail attempts to spoon-feed flies to its two children, but a belly-fluff young crow stomps boisterously between them, scaring them off in its atempt to play.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the fisherman’s hut, in all the trees’ shelters, the air behaves and lets the breath catch up. A juvenile robin is midway through its moult. Soon it will be all grown up, but for now the splash of red leaking from its brown breast makes it look as though it’s been shot. A chiffchaff rushes snatches of song out of the treetops and they are packaged — “29 Jun 2020, 8:00 AM, Walthamstow - Unusual double speed chiffchaff song” — in my ears for later listening. A green woodpecker half-yaffles — yaffs, I suppose — unseen in the wooded neck of land. The colonies on the island are noisy enough though.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By the outflow pipe, on the underwater sandbank it propagates, stands a \u003Cstrong>Grey Heron\u003C/strong>. It’s a beauty, proud and balletic, a bird of the regency period. It’s crotch-deep in the water, but each slow, poised pace it takes does not soak or splash a single feather. Its pronounced black eyebrow — very \u003Cem>a la mode\u003C/em> — extends behind the eye in a mulleted mohican, and thick black stitching perforates the white cravat of its strong, angular neck.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But best of all are the lace-like plumes that descend from its throat and also lie draped across its back. Superlatively delicate and infinitely tasteful. Lakeside haute-couture at its best.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Whenever my mum sees a heron she will comment on how big it looks. Perhaps they \u003Cem>are\u003C/em> getting bigger. This one looks as powerful as any I’ve seen. But also nervous. Unlike those in Holland — which strut about Amsterdam almost as tame as pigeons — British herons are cautious around humans. They tense their bodies and draw the suggestion of a flight-ready S-bend in their necks as soon as a human approaches, planning their departure well in advance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I edge as close as I dare. I notice that the black smudges against the sandy bottom of the lake are not, as I had thought, clumps of water weed. They are the plodding bodies of the giant carp that roam the waterways like trainee manatees. Too big a mouthful for the heron, they swim slowly and safely despite its shadow. They are, I imagine, big enough to have achieved invincibility in our sterile, bear-less country.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A grebe swims next to them, just beneath the surface.

More cautious than before, they fly away immediately as I arrive. Some birds feel like constant companions on my walks &mdash; the swifts, terns, canada geese and linnets &mdash; generous with their time, proximity and visibility. I do not always write about them, but colectively they are generally responsible for at least half the pleasure of the hours I spend at the reserve. They feel like old friends.

But I feel they could put a bit more aggression into it, and their piercing amber eyes could be more watchful.\n\nA little further along a juvenile great black-backed gull has found a dead trout and is tearing at it with its heavy, chisel beak. A couple of adult lesser black-backed gulls try to wrestle the fish away from the giant, pale toddler. They wouldn't dare were it an adult and even though it is already significantly bigger than them, they succeed in tugging the fish back to the water. A herring gull joins in but, on balance, the big old childish bully gets the best of the fight, and tugs some entrails out of the fish's belly. As I draw closer the illegal fish rave disbands. Crows &mdash; winged jackals to the gulls' hyenas &mdash; see their opportunity to extract a beakful, drop in to the brief window that suits their marginally less timid nature. A single common sandpiper peep-peeps its escape too.\n\nWhich reminds me that earlier this morning, as a kind of bonus trip, I cycled up to the top of Lockwood where I saw four common sandpipers in the distance being harrassed by a magpie.

In the same bush I catch a glimpse of a **Jay**'s white rump as it paraglides through and out into the open sapce between the willow trees. Rounding the corner I watch it and another hopping around in the lower branches of a mature sycamore, keeping surprisingly out in the open. \n\nThough both looking very similar as far as colouring goes &mdash; a cross between tinned salmon and tuna, with a black mustache, black, white and electric blue wing panels, black and white rear end and salt and pepperslicked back hair &mdash; one is clearly more submissive, making obvious begging calls and gestures. I did not know fledgling jays looked so much like the adult birds. On closer inspection I can, if I squint, detect an unfinished quality to its patterning, but otherwise it's a vefy accomplished first draft, needing little editing. Its parent squeezes the unripe kernels out of the sycamore helicopter seeds and puts them squarely in its gullet.\n\nWhile it's rare to have such confiding views of the jay's domestic life, tey are pleasantly easy to see here, as indeed in the rest of London. A shy (but noisy) bird of quiet, expansive woodlands in the countryside, it was a highlight of any car journey to see them butterflying from one copse to another, perhaps the only view of one you'd get that month or season. Here in London its not unknown for them to rumage in the tiny front gardens in front of tower blocks on housing estates. A far cry from the memory I have of, sometime in mid winter, somewhere in, or near, North-East Wales, in the kind of silent, leafless (save for the dead ones on the ground) forest they use in thrillers, watching two jays, each one taking its turn on point, making their way through the brown-lit scenery. They will always have that romance for me. But they are crows, after all, that most intelligent, adaptable of families. Like foxes (who share the Jay's frightening screeching), it's their destiny to bring their mystical, rural magic a little closer in.  \n\nAs I leave them I take one final look up into the tree, and see the juvenile's backside pointing down at me.

Sand martins who, let's not forget, have been in the country since early March, are migrating south already, and a steady trickle flows from one reservoir to the next and out the far end. The swifts, as always, are too numerous and whirling to gauge any kind of trend in their movements, but elsewhere a [southward passage of epic proportions](https://www.birdguides.com/articles/a-british-record-day-for-common-swift-passage/) has already begun. Today they do seem to move slower and more thoughtfully though. Two weeks on from the longest day, and they can already feel that the peak of summer has passed.\n\nThe number of tufted ducks is rising fairly rapidly. Crescent-shape flotillas of up to about 50 birds are congregating. Over the next few weeks these will grow to large rafts of hundreds, staying well clear of the shore while they moult. The paths open to the public have made their biannual switch owing to the heronry no longer being the most sensitive nature spectacular on the reserve; the ducks' favoured reservoir to gather on will be largely untroubled by people for the rest of the autumn.\n\nThe starling flock is also growing in size, and I'd estimate it's now at about 120 birds. They never get bigger than a few hundred here, but even at this modest size exhibit the characteristics of the large murmurations that beautify our dull winter skies with their coordinated, animated performances. Today they stretch out into a narrow stream, which recoils back into a tight ball, like wine pouring into a goblet. Their wing beats make a sound like a moth trapped in a lampshade as they take off en masse from their tree.\n\nPerhaps more a sign of the heightening of summer than the nearing of autumn, the giant exotic thistle on the lockwood path is no win bloom. Its flowers are like neon sea anemones, their violet filaments creating a shimmering effect that's difficult to capture in a photograph. The more ordinary thistles and teasels are also coming into bloom, as if they are following the orders of their empress to reproduce.

Despite the tern's super streamlined build, they fly surprisingly laconically, and it tried to dodge rather than outrun the gull's challenging bursts of speed, calling irritably at every successful outmanoeuvre. Eventually the gull grew tired and departed to attack a heron instead. This new tern I watch lilting along turns aggressor at the top of High Maynard and finds the speed to harry a gull for no apparent reason.\n\nThey're all as bad as each other.\n\nA bird I at first mistakenly identify as a crow heaves into view. A dark silhouette against the cloud-whited sky, it flaps determinedly against the wind, before locking its wrists and turning with the breeze. It reveals its true form, with pointed wing tips and splayed oriental fan of a tail, and I realise that I'm looking at a **Kestrel**.\n\nWind adores a kestrel. \n\nIt circles back to obtain a headwind, finds the perfect bite point and hangs still in mid air, with nary a flap of its wings. Most birds, if pushed, can exploit an oncoming wind to hover for a short while. Cliff-nesting seabirds are particularly good at it and will often hang in the updraft before landing. Today, in fact, I've seen both a herring gull and a swift actually flying backwards, seemingly with intent, though with a decided lack of grace.\n\nBut kestrels have made an art form of it. Like a mime artist performing the immovable suitcase trick, their head seems anchored to a specific point in space and their spread tail and fluttering, girder straight wings act as stabilisers to hold it there. Today the wind is strong enough to not require much effort and its only on a couple of its attempts at maintaining a stationary position that it performs the classic, active hovering, fluttering flight.\n\nWith each loop back to find a new spot to look down from, it gets a little further away. Always high up, I can make out the rufous colour of its back, and the impression of a black tip to its long tail, but is still too silhouetted to be able to tell for sure if it is a neat, grey-headed male, or a slightly dowdier looking female. As it recedes it become all shape and behaviour, the circling, the hovering, the pointed wings flicked up into winglets at the tips, and the fascination with the long grass below and the voles and mice that scurry about within.\n\nI take the causeway between the Maynards for my daily constitutional swift bath, standing still as they zip by on both sides. I stand stock still and try not to flinch, feeling like a little scamp playing chicken with passing cars (something I never did &mdash; a boy in my class was killed doing it).

Every day's wind is different, with so much more personality than the little arrowed circles containing numbers on weather maps give the lie to. Each day for the last week will have been represented by a number in the teens, with an arrow pointing somewhere between upwards and to the right but no two days have felt the same. Today's gusty, impish air combines with the silvery light of a resurgent sun to give the feel of a wiley, windy moor. The low-lying plants bent over to show the undersides of their leaves, the fruit trees in the allotments howling, the dried grasses rippling and racing. And the steady pressure of an invisible upland hand resisting every step.\n\nThe water on Lockwood bashes against the concrete in an incessant chain of ankle-high breakers. The water weed growing just below the surface all aligns along the same axis, dragged along by the undertow. The entire body of water acts like a weather station, the water and weeds tracing the speed and direction of the wind, while each gust hits the surface and leaves an imprint looking like a slowly exploding firework.\n\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0077.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0080.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0083.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0086.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0089.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0092.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0095.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0098.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0101.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0104.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0107.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0110.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0113.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0116.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0119.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0122.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0125.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0128.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0131.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0134.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0137.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0140.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0143.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0146.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0149.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0152.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0155.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0158.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0161.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0164.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0167.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0170.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0173.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0176.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0179.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0182.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0185.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0188.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0191.JPG)\n![](/assets/img/windswept-water/IMG_0194.JPG)\n\nThe birds seem befuddled by the wind's boisterousness. An egyptian goose has its thigh and belly feathers back-combed into a magnificent pair of pantaloons. A pied wagtail, suffering a similar fate, is almost blown inside out. I see far more of the pale bellies of linnets than usual as they are tossed almost upside down after take off, and a stock dove &mdash; taken in hand by the gale &mdash; flies along at a pace I'm not sure it's entirely comfortable with. \n\nAt the far end of Lockwood I can see a number of small gulls fluttering above the water. They will almost certainly all be black-headed gulls, but the silver light of the sun does gives their wings a very clean burnish, so I entertain a hope that one or two might be their paler cousin, the mediterranean gull. I hurry over &mdash; not pausing to look for the kingfisher I hear go by near the canal &mdash; As I get closer, I'm proved wrong, but they are still delightful to watch. As if in answer to [yesterday's post](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/2020/07/04/kestrel.html) about the adroit hovering of the kestrel, those in flight all face the wind and, with gentle, tentative demi-flaps of their pale wings, hold still a few feet above the water, occasionaly dipping down to pick whatever it is they eat of the surface. A bunch of them stood on the gravel beach, or bathed nearby, including two of this year's young, wearing a patchwork of country-chic browns and greys.\n\nOn the walk back down the public side of the reservoir I notice some people camped out on the steep grassy bank, enjoying the sun and the wind shadow. I'm inspired to follow their lead and pick my way though the scratchy, intractable patches of wildflowers and find a barer patch of grass to sit on. Again, I am struck by how reminiscent the day is of a ramble across the moors, pausing on a grassy hillside to look down at the fields and villages below. The difference being that here I look across, not down, and the view is of teh two Maynard reservoirs, followed by rows of houses climbing toward the William Morris gallery and Lloyd Park atop the Walthamstow plateau.\n\nOver the reservoirs dribs and drabs of sand martins continue yesterday's migration. In the strange, metallic light that falls on everything today they can look anything from pure white to pitch black as they toss and turn on the breeze. \n\nI slowly scan the sky through my binoculars, hoping to find a buzzard &mdash; they do sometimes drift south from Epping Forest. A few swifts speckle the sky, and then among them a larger bird. My birdwatching fingers rifle through the rolodex of species in my head, coming up with a shortlist then ruling out first woodpigeon (pointed wings swept back, but too slim), and then kestrel (too lanky in the wings), and am left with the one remaining possibility &mdash; I am at last looking at the local **Hobby** once again.\n\nThe hobby is something of a shape-shifter. They're often described as flying like giant swifts, and there is some truth to that, but unlike the swift, whose scythe-shaped wings are permanently locked into that shape, hobbies have a flexible repertoire of poses. When I first see it today its wings are very \"elbow-y\" &mdash; outstretched and slender, but with a go faster kink midway along. When flying like this they remind me of Toothless from \"How to Train your Dragon\", seeming to hunt the very air with an eager, playful energy. A few years ago I was staying on a friend's boat in Reading in the spring, and on an early morning walk I stumbled upon three or four newly arrived hobbies chasing dragonflies with angular-winged aplomb. Still one of my fondest birdwatching memories. As is the first time I ever saw one &mdash; a surprise arrival slicing in to hunt the swallows I was watching outside a farmhouse near Wrexham.\n\nAs it drifts higher and further away it seems to become broader winged, almost peregrine-like. It's a mystery to me where this extra breadth comes from, but I've often noticed it when watching them soar. Maybe they have special extensible flaps, like the ones aeroplanes roll out to land. In May, I watched one circling above me on an evening in Millfields Park and it tried very hard to convince me it was the much rounder-winged kestrel (but comprehensively failed to fly like one). It's not the first time I've seen one there either. They are perhaps one of the more unexpected birds that one can see with some regularity in inner London. \n\nIt continues to soar up and up, and it is with difficulty that I continue tracing it across the sky. Up to a certain distance, birds can be lost from the field of view of the binoculars, refound with the naked eye, and from there returned to their position in your augmented sights. This \"bait and switch\" is, I was surprised to find when passing my binoculars to a friend a few months ago, a learned skill, and many people struggle to find with the binoculars the object that their eyes can find with no difficulty. \n\nThe hobby passed this threshold in no time and my eyes remained glued to the eyepieces, knowing that it would already be invisible to the naked eye. Many's the time that we birdwatchers stare longingly at unidentified remote specimens, willing them to reveal something of their nature. I watched the hobby begin as a distinctly bird-shaped object and shrink until it became a distant speck, alternating between dark and light as it banked to show its belly or its back. It showed its micro-silhouette one last time, then turned pale and passed through the event horizon, falling into the white hole of the clouds, never to reemerge.\n\n![windswept, silver-lit Lockwood](/assets/img/windswept-lockwood.jpg)\n\n[Main image credit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Eurasian_Hobby_%28Falco_subbuteo%29_%2834779228520%29.jpg)","src/data/birds/2020-07-05-hobby.md","f059e40335cd680e",{"html":1129,"metadata":1130},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/hobby.jpg\" alt=\"hobby\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The weather is still not tired of being windy, and I am not yet tired of experiencing and writing about it.

And sends a black-headed gull to hoarsely ward me off the colony. Or is it merely saying hello &mdash; I don't speak gull. A ragged looking tern heads away to fish, pulling at the air with its well-worn wings.\n\nMorning, so sunny and calm, has dropped last week's wind. Tufted ducks dot the water and, without waves for scale, could be sleeping geese. A male **Gadwall**, an elegant grey beast even in the height of its glamour, takes its perfectly proportioned off-season outfit for a pootle around the island. Finely barred in two shades of grey, and with chestnut and white panels on its wing, its tastefully evolved round head tops off a masterclass in understated elegance. Imagine Audrey Hepburn in a film set on a country shooting estate. It skirts around the daunting but childish and relaxed whitish bulk of the resident young great black-backed gull. There is room enough for both on the windless, boring, blue-mirror lake. Under the surface a sub-aqua, algae-lawned atlantis of rubbish, rocks and deadwood shows off its tantalising vistas.\n\n![img](/assets/img/atlantis.jpg)\n\nEvening, the ducks stay damp even through the windows of respite from the pointless rain. Pochards and shelducks have gathered in creches and the young form almost the full sequence of the ascent of duck. The young pochards, already lengthening into the characterisitic submarine shape, get themselves, quite literally, in line. The shelducks are a more unruly bunch and, unlike their more refined child-minders/parents, wonder hither and thither, and take it in turns to dive beneath the surface. They are already taking on the adults' dark-headed, white-bodied looks (so hard to picture when ust a week younger), and soon they will grow out of this diving fad too, and stick to promenading on coastal mudflats instead, like good society shelducks. A greylag goose sneezes and snorts. Even they, apparently, sometimes have trouble with water going down the wrong way.\n\nMorning, and two comma butterlies with beautiful rusty fractal wings accompany a peacock butterfly on the sunsoaked buddleia. A stock dove sings from the ivy, and its milkshake brings all the birds to the yard. First an olive-leaf green chiffchaff trots out onto a sunlit treestump, and nearby a reed warbler tries to fight a blue tit so young it seems stunned by the imposition and does nothing. In the woodpile behind the fisherman's hut &mdash; which will soon be the focus of early autumn birdwatching &mdash; a young dunnock, with a pale, well-marked head, sits preening with its fluffed-up back feathers to the sun. In the upper branches of a nearby bush three fresh-faced, fresh-out-the-nest reed warblers clamber around each other for the best spot in the sun (but had better beware as their white bellies stand out a mile away). Their buff grey foreheads have behind them the unwordly, innocent minds who know nothing but a woven cup of grass and a regularly appearing beak bringing insects.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/sand-martin-citadel.jpg\" style=\"float: right\" />\n\nEvening, as the rain drips down again a herring gull cries mournfully from the island. It inspires others to join the sing-song and soon teh pub is transformed into a chorus of back-slapping and cheers-ing, and now the night is young. Heavy, hessian mats of flies hang in the air, in celebration of the humid tranquility, and beg to be breathed. An army of sand martins descend and cavort like puppies as they sweep up the moist airborne feast. Still arranged in little family groups, they fly in 2's, 3's, 4's and 5's, swarming around the willow tree citadel. They make aborted attempts to settle in the treetops, violently refilling the air with their dense activity on deciding that the hour for bed has not yet come. I leave them circling an oak tree covered island as a murmuration of starling parachute in to roost.\n\nMorning, and a young reed bunting begs with fluttered wings from its marginally more well-marked mother. The young wren is sounding almost professional now. A robin squeezes an infinite number of _tic_ calls into a single trill, and a green woodpecker escapes up the path ahead of me.\n\nEvening, a male reed bunting finds its song and sings it. Goldfinches pull up the blinds on their wild rosebush bedroom, and blackbirds serenade the greenery in their droves. Two chiffchaffs flutter up to investigate the opportunities a pylon has to offer, where our young female green woodpecker greets them with a soft _Chieu Chieu_.\n\nMorning, the geese, tufted ducks and mallards at the water's edge next to the last stretch of path are rudely disturbed into the water, and the multitud of bow waves from so many simultaneously launched waterfowl causes a beautiful diffraction grid to shimmer on the surface. The first waves it has seen today.\n\nEvening, a peregrine, mechanically winged and dramatic, surprises no bird and flies away empty taloned to screech its dismay from its third favourite pylon.\nMorning, fresh as a daisy, rearing to go\n\nEvening, tired, weary and old.\n\n\n![img](/assets/img/morning-swan.jpg)","src/data/birds/2020-07-07-gadwall.md","2ad18e9aaa1bb26c",{"html":1149,"metadata":1150},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/gadwall.jpg\" alt=\"gadwall\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Morning, fresh and youthful.

They are already taking on the adults’ dark-headed, white-bodied looks (so hard to picture when ust a week younger), and soon they will grow out of this diving fad too, and stick to promenading on coastal mudflats instead, like good society shelducks. A greylag goose sneezes and snorts. Even they, apparently, sometimes have trouble with water going down the wrong way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Morning, and two comma butterlies with beautiful rusty fractal wings accompany a peacock butterfly on the sunsoaked buddleia. A stock dove sings from the ivy, and its milkshake brings all the birds to the yard. First an olive-leaf green chiffchaff trots out onto a sunlit treestump, and nearby a reed warbler tries to fight a blue tit so young it seems stunned by the imposition and does nothing. In the woodpile behind the fisherman’s hut — which will soon be the focus of early autumn birdwatching — a young dunnock, with a pale, well-marked head, sits preening with its fluffed-up back feathers to the sun. In the upper branches of a nearby bush three fresh-faced, fresh-out-the-nest reed warblers clamber around each other for the best spot in the sun (but had better beware as their white bellies stand out a mile away). Their buff grey foreheads have behind them the unwordly, innocent minds who know nothing but a woven cup of grass and a regularly appearing beak bringing insects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/sand-martin-citadel.jpg\" style=\"float: right\">\n\u003Cp>Evening, as the rain drips down again a herring gull cries mournfully from the island. It inspires others to join the sing-song and soon teh pub is transformed into a chorus of back-slapping and cheers-ing, and now the night is young. Heavy, hessian mats of flies hang in the air, in celebration of the humid tranquility, and beg to be breathed. An army of sand martins descend and cavort like puppies as they sweep up the moist airborne feast. Still arranged in little family groups, they fly in 2’s, 3’s, 4’s and 5’s, swarming around the willow tree citadel. They make aborted attempts to settle in the treetops, violently refilling the air with their dense activity on deciding that the hour for bed has not yet come. I leave them circling an oak tree covered island as a murmuration of starling parachute in to roost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Morning, and a young reed bunting begs with fluttered wings from its marginally more well-marked mother. The young wren is sounding almost professional now. A robin squeezes an infinite number of \u003Cem>tic\u003C/em> calls into a single trill, and a green woodpecker escapes up the path ahead of me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Evening, a male reed bunting finds its song and sings it. Goldfinches pull up the blinds on their wild rosebush bedroom, and blackbirds serenade the greenery in their droves. Two chiffchaffs flutter up to investigate the opportunities a pylon has to offer, where our young female green woodpecker greets them with a soft \u003Cem>Chieu Chieu\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Morning, the geese, tufted ducks and mallards at the water’s edge next to the last stretch of path are rudely disturbed into the water, and the multitud of bow waves from so many simultaneously launched waterfowl causes a beautiful diffraction grid to shimmer on the surface. The first waves it has seen today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Evening, a peregrine, mechanically winged and dramatic, surprises no bird and flies away empty taloned to screech its dismay from its third favourite pylon.\nMorning, fresh as a daisy, rearing to go\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Evening, tired, weary and old.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/morning-swan.jpg\" alt=\"img\">\u003C/p>",{"headings":1151,"localImagePaths":1152,"remoteImagePaths":1153,"frontmatter":1154,"imagePaths":1157},[],[],[],{"layout":27,"title":1141,"primaryTag":674,"tags":1155,"description":1143,"date":1156},[496,786,629,628,919,674,743,854,672,416,442,522,493,917,391,418,441,413,764,499,521,740,494,393,388],["Date","2020-07-07T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2020-07-06-mistle-thrush",{"id":1158,"data":1160,"body":1165,"filePath":1166,"digest":1167,"rendered":1168},{"title":1161,"date":1162,"description":1163,"primaryTag":982,"tags":1164},"61 Boring Birds: #36 Mistle Thrush",["Date","2020-07-06T00:00:00.000Z"],"Bovver boys",[443,854,419,442,498,417,982,413,851],"![mistle thrush](/assets/img/mistle-thrush.jpg)\n\nAlmost a month to [the day](/2020/06/08/grey-wagtail.html) I last cycled south to look for the little owls on Hackney Marshes, and once again I am disappointed.

They are probably the product of two broods, and represent a good year for the resident pair. In various states of \"undress\", many of them were very clearly mid way through moulting. Some had ochre-washed feathers on the flanks, and I'm not sure if these are fresh or the last, yellowing stumps of the old plumes. Some appear almost white-headed as their feathers thin and the pale, downy bases are revealed.\n\nA few years ago I lived across the road from Millfields Park. A mistle thrush heralded the coming of spring with its morose, short, fluted ditties, delivered from the london plane trees outside my window. From January onwards it was one of the first sounds I heard each morning. While there's nothing inherently wrong with its song, suffice to say that I did grow weary of its ceaseless maudlin whistle, and that's not something one can say about any of its relatives. I'm over it now though, and listen out for it on drizzly, late winter mornings.\n\nToday they hop across the paddock, heads held up and alert, keeping a healthy distance between themselves and the horses. The sound of a punk band rehearsing wafts over from the warehouses towards Leyton, and it does suit the mistle thrush's bovver boy demeanour. I watch one juvenile chiselling away at a particular spot on the ground. It hops about the hole, attacking it from different angles, but try as it might, its determination to eat the grub its caught a whiff of leads to nothing. It has, I notice, a large, dark eye, that is quite beautiful, like that of a Steiner bear, and I sympathise with its empty-beaked plight.\n\nAcross the field a clean, russet fox &mdash; fresh this year perhaps &mdash; flushes a flock of starlings into the trees.

Dunnocks are _everywhere_ &mdash; one of our commonest birds, and tame enough to be fairly certain you'll get within a few yards of one on most days &mdash; and yet, unlike the robin, blackbird, wren or blue tit, nobody has ever heard of them. They are one of the first birds to sing in the \"spring\" (they tend to start in late December or early January) and their song, while not blessed with a killer hook, or much of a melodic structure at all really, is nonetheless a pleasant, unobtrusive but bright accompaniment to a winter's day's stroll.\n\nThey are so unassuming that, until last autumn, I'd never properly learned waht they're calls sound like. A Robin _tic_s, a blackbird _chook_s, a blackcap _tchak_s and a great tit _tchay_s... but it had never really crossed my mind to pay attention to what outher sounds a dunnock makes. Only after half an hour of vainly scanning the cornish seaboard scrub for the mysterious source of a sound did I realise that those nervous, slightly hoarse _seep_ noises, like the highest harmonic from a wheezy old smoker's lungs, came from the ubiquitous grey man of the hedges.\n\nWith no close relatives in the British Isles, they are almost impossible to find in the bird books (they keep moving them around to where there's space!) and battles have raed over whether their colloquial name of hedge sparrow is acceptable to use in print, even, for a time, precipitating the esperanto-like ugly compromise of hedge accentor! I'm not sure where else to mention this, but \"In the book section\" feels apt &mdash; there's a novel about a year in the life of a Dunnock called [Heart of the Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heart_of_the_Valley).

They are one of the first birds to sing in the “spring” (they tend to start in late December or early January) and their song, while not blessed with a killer hook, or much of a melodic structure at all really, is nonetheless a pleasant, unobtrusive but bright accompaniment to a winter’s day’s stroll.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They are so unassuming that, until last autumn, I’d never properly learned waht they’re calls sound like. A Robin _tic_s, a blackbird _chook_s, a blackcap _tchak_s and a great tit _tchay_s… but it had never really crossed my mind to pay attention to what outher sounds a dunnock makes. Only after half an hour of vainly scanning the cornish seaboard scrub for the mysterious source of a sound did I realise that those nervous, slightly hoarse \u003Cem>seep\u003C/em> noises, like the highest harmonic from a wheezy old smoker’s lungs, came from the ubiquitous grey man of the hedges.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With no close relatives in the British Isles, they are almost impossible to find in the bird books (they keep moving them around to where there’s space!) and battles have raed over whether their colloquial name of hedge sparrow is acceptable to use in print, even, for a time, precipitating the esperanto-like ugly compromise of hedge accentor! I’m not sure where else to mention this, but “In the book section” feels apt — there’s a novel about a year in the life of a Dunnock called \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heart_of_the_Valley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Heart of the Valley\u003C/a>. I read it while a teenager, so can’t vouch for its quality, but maybe I should read it again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One final little upsell of the dunnock; apparently they have fascinating sex lives (if I could remember the source of that information I’d include a link, but you’ll just have to imagine it).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s always the quiet ones you have to watch.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.pxfuel.com/en/free-photo-xgspj\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Main image credit\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":1191,"localImagePaths":1192,"remoteImagePaths":1193,"frontmatter":1194,"imagePaths":1197},[],[],[],{"layout":27,"title":1181,"primaryTag":391,"tags":1195,"description":1183,"date":1196},[391,491,742,417,543,441,743,418,495,493,521,918],["Date","2020-07-08T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2020-07-10-buzzard",{"id":1198,"data":1200,"body":1206,"filePath":1207,"digest":1208,"rendered":1209},{"title":1201,"date":1202,"description":1203,"primaryTag":1204,"tags":1205},"61 Boring Birds: #40 Buzzard",["Date","2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z"],"Upstart eagle","Buzzard",[496,919,413,716,494,896,764,441,1204,743],"![buzzard](/assets/img/buzzard.jpg)\n\nSometimes it's not about the birds.\n\nWhich is just as well, because somebody turned the bird-taps off last night.\n\nSometimes it's not especially about the weather either.\n\nAnd again, this standard, insipid July day would've disappointed if it was.\n\nSometimes &mdash; heresy! &mdash; it's not even about writing this blog.\n\nIt can be purely about pacing the earth and slowing the heart to a pace more suitable for what is far from a finely tuned machine.\n\nSo today I took the afternoon to walk and walk and walk, covering almost every inch of the reserve.

This morning I had a substantial lie-in, woke at 10.15 to frenzied activity on my phone &mdash; Pete had found four **Cattle Egrets** perched at the top of the trees on one of the cormorant colony islands, quite possibly the first time any have ever landed at the reserve. I raised myself from bed and within five minutes had dressed and cycled the short distance to where coppermill lan overlooks reservoir No.5. Over the fence I could see three of them adorning the bare, guano-stripped branches.\n\nAnd just like that another bird added to my patch and year lists.\n\nA big cheat.\n\nBy the time I'd made it round to the other side of the lake (pausing en route to try to rediscover a mystery wader one of the volunteers had seen), they had gone, so I suppose I can be allowed to feel a little bit of satisfaction and merit at the speed of my turning out of bed. But all the same, it was a little too easy, and lacked the thrill of the hunt.\n\nWhich is a shame, as cattle egrets are great birds. They are the same species seen in documentaries from the Serengeti, perched on elephant and buffalo shoulders, both transport and commuter comically indifferent to their situation. One of three species of egret to gradually expand their range north through Europe &mdash; the little and the great white being the others &mdash; cattle egrets are getting commoner in the UK, and are starting to breed in a few isolated spots, the first of which was Burton Mere, a stone's throw from my home town, and where I saw my first about five years ago.\n\nTheir little and great white cousins follow the egret template of \"thin white duke\" heron to the letter, but cattle egrets are the not-quite-black sheep of the family. Stockier, with thicker necks and hunched shoulders, their winter whites are transformed with plumes of yellow on the chest and forehead during the breeding season. They are, in short, how Studio Gibli would draw an egret should their next animated fable call for one. The ones that passed through today were apparently in this resplendent, yellow dusted outfit today, though I didn't get close enough to really appreciate the effot they'd put into it.\n\nAnd then I spent most of the afternoon in the woods at Gilbert's Slade, on the edge of Epping Forest, hoping for a glimpse of a nuthatch or treecreeper. The trees were incredibly quiet, with barely a peep out of any creature. Eventually I heard a nuthatch briefly _twoit-twoit_-ing, and might have heard the treecreeper's irritating high-pitched _sree_, but at this time of year, when every young bird from the Atlas Mountains north is primed to make a variety of high-pitched whines, it can be difficult to tell.\n\nTo round off what has been a slightly odd weekend, on my way home I saw and heard a chiffchaff that sounded like a different chaffinch call to the one they normally sound like; a _tchink_ not a _hweet_. I have no idea if any birdwatchers read this blog, but they will appreciate how weird that is. \n\nLike I say... it's been an odd weekend.\n\n![chiffchaffinch calls](/assets/img/chiffchaffinch.png)\n\n[Main Image Credit - Steve Newton](https://twitter.com/sjnewton)","src/data/birds/2020-07-12-cattle-egret.md","7a67474b44bec6ba",{"html":1253,"metadata":1254},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/cattle-egrets.jpg\" alt=\"cattle egrets\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sometimes modern birdwatching feels like a big cheat.

But all the same, it was a little too easy, and lacked the thrill of the hunt.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Which is a shame, as cattle egrets are great birds. They are the same species seen in documentaries from the Serengeti, perched on elephant and buffalo shoulders, both transport and commuter comically indifferent to their situation. One of three species of egret to gradually expand their range north through Europe — the little and the great white being the others — cattle egrets are getting commoner in the UK, and are starting to breed in a few isolated spots, the first of which was Burton Mere, a stone’s throw from my home town, and where I saw my first about five years ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Their little and great white cousins follow the egret template of “thin white duke” heron to the letter, but cattle egrets are the not-quite-black sheep of the family. Stockier, with thicker necks and hunched shoulders, their winter whites are transformed with plumes of yellow on the chest and forehead during the breeding season. They are, in short, how Studio Gibli would draw an egret should their next animated fable call for one. The ones that passed through today were apparently in this resplendent, yellow dusted outfit today, though I didn’t get close enough to really appreciate the effot they’d put into it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And then I spent most of the afternoon in the woods at Gilbert’s Slade, on the edge of Epping Forest, hoping for a glimpse of a nuthatch or treecreeper. The trees were incredibly quiet, with barely a peep out of any creature. Eventually I heard a nuthatch briefly \u003Cem>twoit-twoit\u003C/em>-ing, and might have heard the treecreeper’s irritating high-pitched \u003Cem>sree\u003C/em>, but at this time of year, when every young bird from the Atlas Mountains north is primed to make a variety of high-pitched whines, it can be difficult to tell.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To round off what has been a slightly odd weekend, on my way home I saw and heard a chiffchaff that sounded like a different chaffinch call to the one they normally sound like; a \u003Cem>tchink\u003C/em> not a \u003Cem>hweet\u003C/em>.

Hardly the noble imagine a mature peregrine likes to cultivate.\n\nBut all creatures are young once though, in the case of some birds, not for very long. I've written over the past weeks about the young birds popping up all over the place. Many are now almost indistinguishable from adults, or at least recognisably not far off. Young gulls on the island are beginning to exercise their powerful wings &mdash; not powerful enough to lift off yetm but it won't be long.

The young shelducks are, after a long while looking like they could perhaps turn into swans, finally taking on their parents' shape.

The **Great crested grebe** is one of these.\n\nFor a bird that felt like such a luxurious treat when I was young &mdsah; a highlight of trips to Colemere in Shropshire &mdash; the grebe is surprisingly common. Much like the great spotted woodpecker, once you start to pay attention you realise they're everywhere. Any body of water bigger than about the size of a football pitch is perfect habitat for them, and as the wetlands boasts ten such lakes you can well imagine that grebes are a common bird here, and you'd be right.\n\nThis morning I had the rare pleasure of watching two of them in flight, one of them flying just a few metres ahead of me. They fly direct and fast with rapid beats of wings that are longer and more pointed than their rounded, fluffy, floating bodies give the lie to. Their necks are outstretched and the head held a little lower than the body, with a well-proportioned elegance reminiscent of grecian pottery. \n\nThis elegance is played out to the full in one of the most intimate spectacles of British nature, when a pair perform their courtship ritual. They face one other and coquetishly peck their partner's cheek, with bill puckered downwards and black, tan and white collar feathers ruffled. And then for the finale &mdash; and not every time &mdash; they dive under the water, remerging with beaks full of waterweed and rush towards each, eventually standing upright in a frenzied treading of water and touching of breasts. I've seen the full performance three times, each time at Walthamstow.\n\nThis evening I was treated to the far less aesthetic sight of one of a pair dragging an enormous sheet of waterweed as a contribution to its gradually accumulating nest. It looked like a crocodile, such was the quantity of weed it carried. It may be the same pair who nested early in the year, but their floating nest broke free and sailed ots cargo of an egg over to the reservoir side, where curious lockdown-escaping visitors' overzealous inquisitiveness and photographing eventually led to it being abandoned. \n\nThey weren't the only grebes to breed earlier on the season. There have been a couple of youngsters gradually growing up near the overflow pipe where herons and terns fish. Their frog-like legs and underwater swimming at to the gautlet of fishing styles the fish must evade. And there have been other nesting attempts elsewhere, and maybe some have been successful.\n\nBut late summer tends to be the busy period. At its peak, Low Maynard in particular might contain five or six broods of two to four chicks each, sporting comical, incongruous stripy heads that feel like they shoudl belong to a different species to their parents. Like a caterpillar to a butterfly.\n\nHighlight of watching the chicks is their habit of hitching a ride on their parents' backs, for safety, warmth and, one has to assume, pure idleness. When they are very young it's not uncommon to see a single adult carrying multiple youngsters, their bodies nestled into the adult's downy back feathers and concealed beneath its wings, only the heads peeking out to learn about the world and tease the flummoxed, chick-eating pike.\n\nThis morning I came across a grebe with two chicks close in beneath a willow. As they swam away, one chick climbed onto its back, was absorbed almost instantly and became a stripy conjoined head.\n\nWhat silliness.\n\n![silver sky](/assets/img/silver-sky.jpg)\n\n\n[Main Image Credit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/147485441@N04/36100681466/in/photolist-X16qSw-U2M34u-YGkk2B-2653b8p-U6LZ6v-ZMCdvZ-2izzXXV-2dFnwyd-HKs2K2-U2M38C-24bCA1D-24ioXPe-RnPnZg-2e1iYdJ-RkFoc9-24SaLoi-2hxgHkp-ZQEPC9-2izwbw1-2131owZ-2iTQwBN-HKs5q2-DZq4L9-2djfByk-2iDiKVS-24j5xTZ-24j5xuc-24a15xD-WxU772-24LHTrB-UnqD9q-2gyKpGe-2iRS5mp-UbA5j1-2iCdxKa-2hxfr8a-24oKcGJ-SSQgNC-RcnvZM-K38KPc-RfkXcv-23AMY8C-KYDxNd-236ZAFK-K66qW7-22RcKzu-T3e2U8-VgCBK5-2j6cYGF-2aS8uiy)","src/data/birds/2020-07-16-great-crested-grebe.md","a608e96ed69d3c20",{"html":1293,"metadata":1294},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/great-crested-grebe.jpg\" alt=\"great crested crebe\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This evening a peregrine drew my eye up to the pylon with a few drawn out screeches.

Turn something you love doing into a compulsion and it risks ruining it. Saturday felt like the blog had finally done the deed for my cherished hobby, sapping it of joy and rendering it irksome. And then there's depression too &mdash; that _may_ have played a small part.\n\nBut I took some notes. Reading them back, I'm surprised how many vivid experiences I had. It really didn't feel like it at the time.\n\n![depressed-clouds](/assets/img/depressed-clouds.jpg)\n\nI watched a female kestrel kestrelling far better than any I have previously observed in London. It hovered, glued to the spot, maybe 100 metres high above the Tottenham Marsh allotments. Like a circus artist on a slack line it constantly adjusted its corrective movements in response to the tiny stimuli from its inconstant keeper, making deep chested wing beats one moment, and merely sending a shiver up its arms the next. And all the time its head held perfectly still. \n\nReaching for my notebook, I took my eyes off it for only a few seconds, and it was mysteriously gone, only to re-emerge with a vole in its talons. In all my years watching kestrels hunt like this, I don't think I've ever seen a successful hunt before. It flew off south, to the nest one presumes. A few seconds later a sparrowhawk hove into view, also with an unfortunate meal clasped in its claws. Good hunting this weekend.\n\nI watched the large gulls on the centre of the reservoir. They like to gather here, as far from mammalian interference as is possible. Sometimes the flock will increase up to about 100 birds, but this weekend it's been a more normal twenty or so. It's a good season to look out for unusual visitors as immature birds and unsuccessful breeders spread out over Europe from their main breeding locations. \n\nThere is a breed of birdwathcer &mdash; the \"guller\" &mdash; who specialises in telling apart all these subtly different birds on their multi-year, multi-moult journey from newly fledged chick to adulthood. They use arcane terminology such as \"mirrors\" (the small white markings near a gull's wingtips), 1cy, 2cy and 3cy (first calendar year etc), and latin names for subscpecies such as _fuscus_ and _argentatus_, and obsess and salivate over (in a way that I think is quite sweet, but others think of as demented) some really quite drably decorated young birds. \n\nI am a 2cy _gallus_ guller, and have lost some of my immature plumage. I'm still far from a fully grown guller, though I do see its attractions and even have a handful of \"nice gull found\" feathers in my cap. In particular, last summer I found a yellow-legged gull &mdash; the continental equivalent to our familiar, chip stealing herring gull &mdash; at the reservoirs. Slightly larger, darker backed and whiter fronted than the more uniformly mottled grey herring gull, it felt like a real milestone to have crossed the line from, \"I think I've found one,\" to, \"I've found one.\" \n\nThis weekend I do wonder if I've found the same bird again (some gulls do demonstrate astonishing loyalty to very specific locations &mdash; one caspian gull has spent the last few winters at a pond in Wanstead, despite probably spending most of its year in Central Europe). What looked quite like a 2cy yellow-legged gull &mdash; dark around the eyes, and slightly larger than the herrings &mdash; was bathing energetically mid-lake, and showed off the characteristic clean dark band on a white tail as it flew away... but on this occasion I think I need a repeat viewing to be sure. Never mind. There was a nice, smokey brown lesser black-backed gull, fresh from one of this year's nests to enjoy too.\n\nOther than that, I sat in the sun until the flies began to rise, then cycled off for my first visit to a pub since March. Cycling back, the sun was gettting close to the horizon. I took a detour through Lammas meadow and then the main Walthamstow Marsh, enjoying the golden hour's light dancing on the feathery grass stems.\n\nGroups of between 10 and 40 **Ring-necked parakeets** made their way home to their communal roost in the trees that border Hackney Marshes. Normally not a favourite of birdwatchers &mdash; invasive, noisy and \"a bit obvious\", for want of a better insult &mdash; every dog does nevertheless have its day. For the parakeets it's the hour of the day before sunset.\n\nIt's uncanny to see a few black dots in close formation &mdash; like a hail of bullets in a Hanna-Barbera cartoon &mdash; careering between the trees down the airstrip running the length of the canal. They emit an oddly civilized dialogue of _kya!_s as they go. Drawing closer, in front of a dark backdrop of trees or flats, they become elongated and reveal their true, irridescent lime green nature. Flying past at speed, you can hear their collective wingbeats dividing the air with a single, large pressure wave.

Turn something you love doing into a compulsion and it risks ruining it. Saturday felt like the blog had finally done the deed for my cherished hobby, sapping it of joy and rendering it irksome. And then there’s depression too — that \u003Cem>may\u003C/em> have played a small part.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But I took some notes. Reading them back, I’m surprised how many vivid experiences I had. It really didn’t feel like it at the time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/depressed-clouds.jpg\" alt=\"depressed-clouds\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I watched a female kestrel kestrelling far better than any I have previously observed in London. It hovered, glued to the spot, maybe 100 metres high above the Tottenham Marsh allotments. Like a circus artist on a slack line it constantly adjusted its corrective movements in response to the tiny stimuli from its inconstant keeper, making deep chested wing beats one moment, and merely sending a shiver up its arms the next. And all the time its head held perfectly still.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Reaching for my notebook, I took my eyes off it for only a few seconds, and it was mysteriously gone, only to re-emerge with a vole in its talons. In all my years watching kestrels hunt like this, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a successful hunt before. It flew off south, to the nest one presumes. A few seconds later a sparrowhawk hove into view, also with an unfortunate meal clasped in its claws. Good hunting this weekend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I watched the large gulls on the centre of the reservoir. They like to gather here, as far from mammalian interference as is possible. Sometimes the flock will increase up to about 100 birds, but this weekend it’s been a more normal twenty or so. It’s a good season to look out for unusual visitors as immature birds and unsuccessful breeders spread out over Europe from their main breeding locations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is a breed of birdwathcer — the “guller” — who specialises in telling apart all these subtly different birds on their multi-year, multi-moult journey from newly fledged chick to adulthood. They use arcane terminology such as “mirrors” (the small white markings near a gull’s wingtips), 1cy, 2cy and 3cy (first calendar year etc), and latin names for subscpecies such as \u003Cem>fuscus\u003C/em> and \u003Cem>argentatus\u003C/em>, and obsess and salivate over (in a way that I think is quite sweet, but others think of as demented) some really quite drably decorated young birds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I am a 2cy \u003Cem>gallus\u003C/em> guller, and have lost some of my immature plumage. I’m still far from a fully grown guller, though I do see its attractions and even have a handful of “nice gull found” feathers in my cap. In particular, last summer I found a yellow-legged gull — the continental equivalent to our familiar, chip stealing herring gull — at the reservoirs. Slightly larger, darker backed and whiter fronted than the more uniformly mottled grey herring gull, it felt like a real milestone to have crossed the line from, “I think I’ve found one,” to, “I’ve found one.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This weekend I do wonder if I’ve found the same bird again (some gulls do demonstrate astonishing loyalty to very specific locations — one caspian gull has spent the last few winters at a pond in Wanstead, despite probably spending most of its year in Central Europe). What looked quite like a 2cy yellow-legged gull — dark around the eyes, and slightly larger than the herrings — was bathing energetically mid-lake, and showed off the characteristic clean dark band on a white tail as it flew away… but on this occasion I think I need a repeat viewing to be sure. Never mind. There was a nice, smokey brown lesser black-backed gull, fresh from one of this year’s nests to enjoy too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Other than that, I sat in the sun until the flies began to rise, then cycled off for my first visit to a pub since March. Cycling back, the sun was gettting close to the horizon. I took a detour through Lammas meadow and then the main Walthamstow Marsh, enjoying the golden hour’s light dancing on the feathery grass stems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Groups of between 10 and 40 \u003Cstrong>Ring-necked parakeets\u003C/strong> made their way home to their communal roost in the trees that border Hackney Marshes. Normally not a favourite of birdwatchers — invasive, noisy and “a bit obvious”, for want of a better insult — every dog does nevertheless have its day. For the parakeets it’s the hour of the day before sunset.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s uncanny to see a few black dots in close formation — like a hail of bullets in a Hanna-Barbera cartoon — careering between the trees down the airstrip running the length of the canal. They emit an oddly civilized dialogue of _kya!_s as they go. Drawing closer, in front of a dark backdrop of trees or flats, they become elongated and reveal their true, irridescent lime green nature. Flying past at speed, you can hear their collective wingbeats dividing the air with a single, large pressure wave. For a fleeting moment it’s like being in the opening sequence of a David Attenborough documentary about the Amazon rainforest.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And then they are gone to join their brethren, and England is returned, though within a minute another crew will fly past and rekindle the tropical magic.

They also fly with a far lighter, butterfly-like flight. They are gulls re-branded as tropical angels.\n\nAnd tropical is the appropriate adjective.

A goldfinch bonanza greeted me, with special guest appearances from the young great spotted woodpecker (attempting to chisel its way into one of the bushy galls growing on the willows) and a parakeet parachuting down in carnival colours. Even the humble coot, backlit and running agressively across the water, looked like a scene from an 80s music video.\n\nPlenty of aerobatic excitement from the terns and gulls too, and a newly fledged tern &mdash; most likely a visitor from the Ponder's End colony &mdash; sat on the reservoir banks whining to be fed, which it duly was when a parent deposited a little fish in its unrefined gob. They look so funny when they're young, stocky shouldered, scribble-winged, altogether badly drawn and out of proportion. The kind of tern fan art that gets sketched in the inside cover of the exercise books of seabird teenagers. \n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is where today's Walthamstow story ends. Because today I treated myself to a day off work and headed out into the Essex countryside on my bike instead. And there is much to tell.\n\nI find it remarkable that within ten minutes ride I can be at Gilbert's slade, a respectable glade in the midst of a mixture of oak and hornbeam trees. Another half an hour, a few miles up a gradual incline, and I'm in the heart of Epping Forest (by which I, of course, mean the [biker's cafe](http://www.originalteahut.com/)). Then it's only another twenty minutes to the other side of the M25 (which very considerately passes through a long tunnel), and out into the open Essex countryside.\n\nAnd it's quite the tonic. The first time I've properly been out of the city since March. Get me in a strident mood and you may find I have lots to say about the damaging effects of monoculture farming, dividing the countryside into vast fields of a single crop at the expense of wildlife and, counterintitively, the long-term productivity of the soil. Green deserts, they're known as.\n\nBut roll me down a gentle hill with a blue sea of flax to my left and wheat to my right, and put just one (as opposed to the dozens of yesteryear) **Yellowhammer** in a hedge to serenade me with its _a little bit of bread and no cheeeeeeese_ song, and all is forgiven. I thank my lucky buntings that the farmers found it in their hearts to lay such perfection in my path.\n\n![flax](/assets/img/flax.jpg)\n\nThe yellowhammer was the first contender to be today's title bird. The second brightest bird in Britain (after the yellow wagtail), in the right light they shine like fiery beacons from the hedges, spanish yellow below with a rich, streaky tan back. I used to see and hear them on my walks to sixth form college when I was young, but I doubt they can still be found there now; their population, like that of so many farmland birds, is plummetting. \n\nBut today it was pleasant to hear good numbers of them along a two or three mile stretch of fields. By the vagaries of the London Natural History Society, technically this means I have now added yellowhammer to my London list. Unlike many finch-like farmland birds, yellowhammers seem reluctant to venture any further into London, even during cold spells. But the definition of London used by the LNHS is a circle of radius 20 miles centred at St. Paul's Cathedral, which means the _fields_ I observed them in lie well within the city limits.\n\nContinuing on past that first birding highlight I descended to the valley floor, and then climbed the other side to an area known as Epping Upland, and then on to an area of open access land known as Nazeingwood Common. These names come to me via an Ordnace Survey map I invested in. Years ago when on a roadtrip through Sweden, and holding just as true on a bike in Essex, I learned that map apps, in their necessary drive to cut out clutter and \"optimise teh user journey\", are enemies of serendipity. Without the paper map there's no way I would have taken today's off the beaten track detour down an alley behind a pub, emerging out onto the common.\n\n![wheat](/assets/img/wheat.jpg)\n\nNot that Nazeingwood Common deserves the name. It's as perfect an example of intensively farmed arable land as you could hope to find, covered with absurdly swollen, thoroughbred wheat. The right to wander unrestricted across the open access fields clearly hasn't been exercised of late. Nevertheless, it was home to the most yellowhammers I saw today, gave me a fun glimpse of a red-legged partridge fleeing my bike's rattling over the furrowed ground and, best of all, delivered a **Skylark** to sermonise from on high on the joys of country living.\n\nSkylarks are surprisingly big &mdash; closer to a starling than a sparrow &mdash; but as they are normally seen suspended way up in the sky on tremulous wings, they do usually appear to be very small, delicate creatures. Despite broadcasting their presence with a breathless, unending stream of garbled honey notes, they can still be fiendishly difficult to find. Even though they are not much to look at &mdash; a streaky, sandy brown thing with the hint of a crest on its head &mdash; and their undoubted selling point is their song, there's not a birdwatcher alive who can be satisfied without finding the bird in their binoculars. That's just the way it is. Fortunately today's gave itself away without much of a fight, so I could go back to enjoying the music.\n\n\u003Caudio controls>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/skylark.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\u003C/audio>\n\nHaving crossed the common, and the day still relatively unadvanced in both time and heat, I spun the map again and ended up (after a yomp up a steep muddy bridleway &mdash; no fun on a road bike) in a narrow strip of woodland atop a broad ridge. I sat under the ship's-timber-straight oaks to sate my thirst and catch my breath, and was joined by a roving tit flock.\n\nAll human activities have their arcane nomencalature, and birdwatching is no different. Some birds have their behaviour habitually referred to using very specific verbs. To _rove_ means to:\n\n> travel constantly without a fixed destination; wander.\n\nWhich could apply to any number of birds, but for some reason in ornithology it is used almost exclusively to refer to flocks of tits &mdash; sometimes accompabied by related birds such as finches or warblers &mdash; foraging for food in the woods from late summer through to late winter. \n\nNaming curiosities aside, they are a delight to watch. Blue tits and long-tailed tits in particular are consumate acrobats and will dangle upside down from the flimsiest of twigs or loosely attached tree accoutrements (or treecoutrements) in search of some insect to devour. Today they were joined by three or four **Treecreepers**, probably a family, working their way from tree to tree. \n\nTreecreepers land low down on a tree trunk and then climb vertically up it, travelling so quickly and so seemingly attached to the bark that (stretching the imagination, admittedly) it's as if they are miniature, gravity-defying seals, belly-flopping their way upwards towards some arboreal fishy treat.\n\nI continued along the bridleway, which was clearly much-used by horses (much to the disquiet of my poor, decidedly not off-road cycling contraption). Arriving at a natural location to check the map I waited a while to try to find the buzzard noisily mewing overhead, but was once again entranced by another retinue of rovers flitting through the impressive stand of oaks. I saw the back end of a bird sticking out from behind a twisted, bleached branch of a dead tree, then another landed next to it, the first dropped an vibrated its wings to beg and, presumably, a meal was transferred. But all, aside from the tail, rump and wingtips of the young bird, obscured from view.\n\nThen both birds flew to new perches and revealed themselves to be **Spotted flycatchers**, big-eyed, dull-feathered mannequins of the woodland edge. The adult made little sallies (another verb-bird pairing) out to snatch insects in mid air, its surprisingly broad beak and long, almost swallow-like wings giving it the agility and chops to make it look easy hundreds of times a day. They taught Obama everything he knows about catching flies. *edit - I've just found out they barely breed in \"London\" any more, so finding a hitherto unknown breeding site is quite exciting.*\n\nAnd down, up and down the clay tracks &mdash; so much so I think my cosseted, metropolitan wheels were starting to enjoy it &mdash; to arrive, finally, back in the familiar lea valley of this blog's usual tales. I checked its usual spot at Fisher's Green for my favourite fox, then pedalled south with tiring legs. The tarmaced track through the Cheshunt segment of the Lea Country Park was, bizarrely, festooned with lots of small birds &mdash; even slavishly tree-dwelling ones, such as tits &mdash; creeping about on the ground. Most unusual to see. I guessed they might be hoovering up the remnants of yesterday's flying ant day spectacular.\n\nOne final detour (no map needed this time; back on home turf) around Hall Marsh. These marshy fields surrounding a shallow, reedy pool can be good for geese and snipe in winter. In the early weeks of lockdown I came across some lapwings here &mdash; perhaps a sign that they breed. But now that summer is in full swing it's difficult to see anything as the impressive variety of waterside plants have grown to block views from most vantage points.\n\nI did however take the trouble to visit them all and at the very last one was able to get a clear-ish view of the water and a muddy island set in the middle of it. Sat on a bench in a half-enclosed hide I was happy to rest my legs and so, despite the lack of any birds, remained seated and continued to scan through my binoculars. After a few minutes I was rewarded with the semi-obscured sight of a wader bobbing behind some brush-like vegetation.\n\nEvidently a fresh water sandpiper of some kind &mdash; dark on top, light below, long-legged with a well-proportioned, pencil-thin bill &mdash; my instinct was that I was looking at a **Green sandpiper**. Green sandpipers wouldn't be anything as helpful as being \"the green one\" &mdash; they are no greener than the other two species commonly seen in Britain &mdash; but its back seemed a little darker, and its body more attenuated towards the rear giving it, as it bobbed up and down, the look of a stick being waggled at a chalkboard rather than of a duck bobbing on choppy water; such are the clues a birdwatcher goes by, deeply personal and difficult to define, they lead you towards which species feels right for this bird. For the uninitiated, this is what's known (somewhat embarrassingly given the word's more erotic homonym) as a bird's _jizz_.\n\nAfter a little more patient waiting it stepped further into the open, showing that the faded streaks on its throat ended at a line level with the bend in its folded wings, and once or twice it stretched its neck upwards, achieving a racehorse-like elan that its cousin, the common sandpiper, woudl look rdiculous trying to imitate. Finally, as if giving more and more obvious clues in a television phone-in quiz, it stretched its wings to show the black undersides that can make it look like a giant house martin in flight (I was sceptical of this mnemonic until, earlier this spring, I actually mistook one for an early house martin).\n\nQuite satisfied that it had been &mdash; to use the parlance of the day &mdash; \"seen\", it swam across to the island and promptly sat down for a nap. No sooner had it done so than another hove into obstructed view and I waited another five minutes for it to swim across for a nap too before I was completely convinced that it wasn't the far rarer wood sandpiper. \n\nWishful thinking. Very much in keeping with the mood of the day.\n\n![bike](/assets/img/bike.jpg)\n\n[Main image credit](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Green_Sandpiper_(Tringa_ochropus)_(33258437544).jpg)","src/data/birds/2020-07-13-green-sandpiper.md","187ce893d5524d8a",{"html":1358,"metadata":1359},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/green-sandpiper.jpg\" alt=\"green sandpiper\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Waking early once more for a wonder around the reserve, I was rewarded with all manner of sights and sounds. A goldfinch bonanza greeted me, with special guest appearances from the young great spotted woodpecker (attempting to chisel its way into one of the bushy galls growing on the willows) and a parakeet parachuting down in carnival colours. Even the humble coot, backlit and running agressively across the water, looked like a scene from an 80s music video.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Plenty of aerobatic excitement from the terns and gulls too, and a newly fledged tern — most likely a visitor from the Ponder’s End colony — sat on the reservoir banks whining to be fed, which it duly was when a parent deposited a little fish in its unrefined gob. They look so funny when they’re young, stocky shouldered, scribble-winged, altogether badly drawn and out of proportion. The kind of tern fan art that gets sketched in the inside cover of the exercise books of seabird teenagers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is where today’s Walthamstow story ends. Because today I treated myself to a day off work and headed out into the Essex countryside on my bike instead. And there is much to tell.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I find it remarkable that within ten minutes ride I can be at Gilbert’s slade, a respectable glade in the midst of a mixture of oak and hornbeam trees. Another half an hour, a few miles up a gradual incline, and I’m in the heart of Epping Forest (by which I, of course, mean the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.originalteahut.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">biker’s cafe\u003C/a>). Then it’s only another twenty minutes to the other side of the M25 (which very considerately passes through a long tunnel), and out into the open Essex countryside.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And it’s quite the tonic. The first time I’ve properly been out of the city since March. Get me in a strident mood and you may find I have lots to say about the damaging effects of monoculture farming, dividing the countryside into vast fields of a single crop at the expense of wildlife and, counterintitively, the long-term productivity of the soil. Green deserts, they’re known as.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But roll me down a gentle hill with a blue sea of flax to my left and wheat to my right, and put just one (as opposed to the dozens of yesteryear) \u003Cstrong>Yellowhammer\u003C/strong> in a hedge to serenade me with its \u003Cem>a little bit of bread and no cheeeeeeese\u003C/em> song, and all is forgiven. I thank my lucky buntings that the farmers found it in their hearts to lay such perfection in my path.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/flax.jpg\" alt=\"flax\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The yellowhammer was the first contender to be today’s title bird. The second brightest bird in Britain (after the yellow wagtail), in the right light they shine like fiery beacons from the hedges, spanish yellow below with a rich, streaky tan back. I used to see and hear them on my walks to sixth form college when I was young, but I doubt they can still be found there now; their population, like that of so many farmland birds, is plummetting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But today it was pleasant to hear good numbers of them along a two or three mile stretch of fields. By the vagaries of the London Natural History Society, technically this means I have now added yellowhammer to my London list. Unlike many finch-like farmland birds, yellowhammers seem reluctant to venture any further into London, even during cold spells. But the definition of London used by the LNHS is a circle of radius 20 miles centred at St. Paul’s Cathedral, which means the \u003Cem>fields\u003C/em> I observed them in lie well within the city limits.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Continuing on past that first birding highlight I descended to the valley floor, and then climbed the other side to an area known as Epping Upland, and then on to an area of open access land known as Nazeingwood Common. These names come to me via an Ordnace Survey map I invested in. Years ago when on a roadtrip through Sweden, and holding just as true on a bike in Essex, I learned that map apps, in their necessary drive to cut out clutter and “optimise teh user journey”, are enemies of serendipity. Without the paper map there’s no way I would have taken today’s off the beaten track detour down an alley behind a pub, emerging out onto the common.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/wheat.jpg\" alt=\"wheat\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not that Nazeingwood Common deserves the name. It’s as perfect an example of intensively farmed arable land as you could hope to find, covered with absurdly swollen, thoroughbred wheat. The right to wander unrestricted across the open access fields clearly hasn’t been exercised of late. Nevertheless, it was home to the most yellowhammers I saw today, gave me a fun glimpse of a red-legged partridge fleeing my bike’s rattling over the furrowed ground and, best of all, delivered a \u003Cstrong>Skylark\u003C/strong> to sermonise from on high on the joys of country living.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Skylarks are surprisingly big — closer to a starling than a sparrow — but as they are normally seen suspended way up in the sky on tremulous wings, they do usually appear to be very small, delicate creatures. Despite broadcasting their presence with a breathless, unending stream of garbled honey notes, they can still be fiendishly difficult to find. Even though they are not much to look at — a streaky, sandy brown thing with the hint of a crest on its head — and their undoubted selling point is their song, there’s not a birdwatcher alive who can be satisfied without finding the bird in their binoculars. That’s just the way it is. Fortunately today’s gave itself away without much of a fight, so I could go back to enjoying the music.\u003C/p>\n\u003Caudio controls>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/skylark.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\u003C/audio>\n\u003Cp>Having crossed the common, and the day still relatively unadvanced in both time and heat, I spun the map again and ended up (after a yomp up a steep muddy bridleway — no fun on a road bike) in a narrow strip of woodland atop a broad ridge. I sat under the ship’s-timber-straight oaks to sate my thirst and catch my breath, and was joined by a roving tit flock.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All human activities have their arcane nomencalature, and birdwatching is no different. Some birds have their behaviour habitually referred to using very specific verbs. To \u003Cem>rove\u003C/em> means to:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>travel constantly without a fixed destination; wander.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Which could apply to any number of birds, but for some reason in ornithology it is used almost exclusively to refer to flocks of tits — sometimes accompabied by related birds such as finches or warblers — foraging for food in the woods from late summer through to late winter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Naming curiosities aside, they are a delight to watch. Blue tits and long-tailed tits in particular are consumate acrobats and will dangle upside down from the flimsiest of twigs or loosely attached tree accoutrements (or treecoutrements) in search of some insect to devour. Today they were joined by three or four \u003Cstrong>Treecreepers\u003C/strong>, probably a family, working their way from tree to tree.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Treecreepers land low down on a tree trunk and then climb vertically up it, travelling so quickly and so seemingly attached to the bark that (stretching the imagination, admittedly) it’s as if they are miniature, gravity-defying seals, belly-flopping their way upwards towards some arboreal fishy treat.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I continued along the bridleway, which was clearly much-used by horses (much to the disquiet of my poor, decidedly not off-road cycling contraption). Arriving at a natural location to check the map I waited a while to try to find the buzzard noisily mewing overhead, but was once again entranced by another retinue of rovers flitting through the impressive stand of oaks. I saw the back end of a bird sticking out from behind a twisted, bleached branch of a dead tree, then another landed next to it, the first dropped an vibrated its wings to beg and, presumably, a meal was transferred. But all, aside from the tail, rump and wingtips of the young bird, obscured from view.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then both birds flew to new perches and revealed themselves to be \u003Cstrong>Spotted flycatchers\u003C/strong>, big-eyed, dull-feathered mannequins of the woodland edge. The adult made little sallies (another verb-bird pairing) out to snatch insects in mid air, its surprisingly broad beak and long, almost swallow-like wings giving it the agility and chops to make it look easy hundreds of times a day. They taught Obama everything he knows about catching flies. \u003Cem>edit - I’ve just found out they barely breed in “London” any more, so finding a hitherto unknown breeding site is quite exciting.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And down, up and down the clay tracks — so much so I think my cosseted, metropolitan wheels were starting to enjoy it — to arrive, finally, back in the familiar lea valley of this blog’s usual tales. I checked its usual spot at Fisher’s Green for my favourite fox, then pedalled south with tiring legs. The tarmaced track through the Cheshunt segment of the Lea Country Park was, bizarrely, festooned with lots of small birds — even slavishly tree-dwelling ones, such as tits — creeping about on the ground. Most unusual to see. I guessed they might be hoovering up the remnants of yesterday’s flying ant day spectacular.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One final detour (no map needed this time; back on home turf) around Hall Marsh. These marshy fields surrounding a shallow, reedy pool can be good for geese and snipe in winter. In the early weeks of lockdown I came across some lapwings here — perhaps a sign that they breed. But now that summer is in full swing it’s difficult to see anything as the impressive variety of waterside plants have grown to block views from most vantage points.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I did however take the trouble to visit them all and at the very last one was able to get a clear-ish view of the water and a muddy island set in the middle of it. Sat on a bench in a half-enclosed hide I was happy to rest my legs and so, despite the lack of any birds, remained seated and continued to scan through my binoculars. After a few minutes I was rewarded with the semi-obscured sight of a wader bobbing behind some brush-like vegetation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Evidently a fresh water sandpiper of some kind — dark on top, light below, long-legged with a well-proportioned, pencil-thin bill — my instinct was that I was looking at a \u003Cstrong>Green sandpiper\u003C/strong>.

But if, like me, you'd begun the day at seven, you'd have seen a surprisingly cool and overcast start to the day, more in keeping with October. So the rest of the day was an unexpected outcome.\n\nI go on about the coming of autumn a lot, and there were more signs today. It's perhaps not so much the comming of autumn but the ending of summer. The birds are, one by one, losing the urge to sing, just as tired old couples can lose the flirtatious spark. Sedge and reed warblers and whitethroats, still filling their respective undergrowth, reedbeds and bushes with their particular variety of rattling just a few weeks ago, have fallen silent. Reed buntings still sing their creaky few notes now and again, but the collcted menagerie of bird life no longer fizzes around the reserve. This gives the classic feel of midsummer birding &mdash; the silent hedgerow under the baking sun, the hum of crickets in the dry grass the dominant sound now, and everything needing a drink of water.\n\nSome other familiar faces were showing the signs of transitioning to a new stage of life. The juvenile grey wagtail around East Warwick I've introduced before now sports a respectably grown up long tail and bright yellow vent feathers, but still gives away its youth by it's still pinkish legs. A sand martin, changing direction alongside me, fanned its wings and showed it was already moulting. A [bit of research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00063658009476656?needAccess=true&) has taught me that mostly they moult in their African wintering quarters, but a tiny minority may start before they leave. I'm enjoying the little details of these orinary birds I'm picking up in these two months of intensive interest-seeking.\n\nAnd on the tern colony island one of the oldest chicks gave its wings a vigorous flap in preparation for flight in a day or two. I watched a cloud of cantankerous terns wheeling above the inflow pipe on No. 3 reservoir, picking arguments and engaging in minor skirmishes with each other &mdash; jostling for the best fishing spot one woudl imagine, although they are in such constant, wheeling motion it hardly seems to matter. Every so often a tern would halt, splay its forked tail (looking like fairy wings) and hover before plunging for a fish and leaving to deliver it to junior. With these repeat close up views of them flying by just above eye level I noticed, for the first time in my life, how cute and pointless their little cartoon legs look in flight, like the nut-holding hands of a squirrel or the legendary useless arms of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\n![tern-cloud2](/assets/img/tern-cloud2.jpg)\n\nAt this watering hole they tolerate &mdash; or are tolerated by is likely more accurate &mdash; the resident heron most days, but the opposite is far from true. A heron flying above the colony triggered the most virulent flash-mobbing I think I've seen yet, with every tern and black-headed gull focusing their energy on repelling the lanky intruder. As my Essex friends might put it, it was \"mobbed to shit!\". One tern transformed in an instant from laconically surveying the shallows into heron seeking missile, answering the signal with a powerful, dart-like turn of speed. I also saw an aggressive chase between some grebes. Maybe there's something in the water.\n\n![tern-cloud1](/assets/img/tern-cloud1.jpg)\n\nDespite the chill, dull morning, I walked the reserve's many paths with a spring in my step becaue, before all this happened, I broke my several week drought of not finding anything particularly noteworthy on the reserve. Nothing to post in the \"Walthamstow Birders Alert\" rather than the \"Walthamstow Birders Chat\" channel. \n\nI found a **Whinchat**.\n\nWhinchats are one of the bellwether spring and summer migrants, with a few hundred passing through London each year, and among the earliest to pass through in both spring, and especially autumn. I'm pretty familiar with the figures because last year I volunteered to help edit the London Bird Report. Being a beginner I was allocated just three species &mdash; the closely related stonechat, whinchat and wheatear. Collating the reports from two years ago, and being a programmer by trade, I couldn't resist visualising their records &mdash; green for spring, blue for autumn shows the wheatear is commoner in spring, and the whinchat in autumn.\n\n\u003Cfigure style=\"width: 45%; float: left\">\u003Cimg alt=\"wheatear london bird records 2020\" src=\"/assets/img/wheatear.svg\" />\u003Ccaption>Wheatear\u003C/caption>\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cfigure style=\"width: 45%; float: left\">\u003Cimg alt=\"whinchat london bird records 2020\" src=\"/assets/img/whinchat.svg\" />\u003Ccaption>Whinchat\u003C/caption>\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cdiv style=\"clear: left\">\u003C/div>\n\nI was also ingratiated to find in among them my own record at Walthamstow, not long after being invited into the Whatsapp group, and the first time I think I'd ever found a bird of note on the patch. Whinchats and I have history.\n\nThis history predates my time in London. In my teenage years I'd be driven around various northern birding hotspots by the kind members of [Wrexham Birdwatchers](https://birdsin.wales/useful-links/wrexham-birdwatchers/). On one occasion, driving back from Lake Vyrnwy with Norman and Pauline, we stopped off near a hairpin bend on one of the countless single track roads criss-crossing the mid-Wales uplands. Surrounded by bracken, drying in the high summer sun (temperatures likely a lowly 22-23 degrees, but warm for Wales), we were treated to a display of umpteen whinchats ticking us off from their perches in the invasive jungle of hardy ferns. I _think_ that's the first time I ever saw one.\n\nBecause whinchats &mdash; unlike their ubiquitous scrubland cousin the Stonechat &mdash; are far more localised and selective where they spend their time, and are not a bird you inevitably run into. Most times I've seen them in their breeding grounds, they have been gathered together in something like a distributed colony, for some reason preferring a particular expanse of bracken or gorse over the seemingly identical nearby ones. [Eglwyseg](http://www.grabyourboots.com/walks/world-s-end-along-the-eglwyseg-mountain) &mdash; one of the many alternate names for the moors to the west of Wrexham &mdash; is largely inhabited by stonechats, except for in a handful of locations (that I know of) where the whinchat is king. During migration too, while stonechats and wheatears pop up all over the place in ones and twos, I'm told that whinchat can reliably be found in numbers in the bomb crater field &mdash; so named after an exploded V2 rocket &mdash; on Walthamstow Marsh.\n\nToday's specimen was as delightful an example as any I've seen before, with that added cachet of being the bird to put an end to my mid-summer doldrums. Walking up the east bank of Lockwood &mdash; my attention fixed on a putative yellow-legged gull gliding in to land in the distance &mdash; I paid little attention to my immediate surroundings until a flock of linnet bounced up just ahead of me, and a companion of theirs scarpered in the opposite direction, flying low over the water to seek refuge on one of the vegetated rafts. With  a little light colouring on the sides of its tail and white patches on its shoulders it had to be a whinchat!\n\nOr a stonechat...?\n\nIt can be difficult to tell without a proper view, and I began to doubt if the pale parts of the tail were really white or maybe a trick of the light, and I've made mistakes before. So began the battle of wills between the birdwatcher on the shore and the small bird skulking among the weeds some 100 metres away. I think birdwatching appeals to many parts of the psyche, and this kind of stakeout I think is a far more rewarding workout for the hunter and puzzle-solver in the mind than fishing, crosswords or computer games.\n\nThe challenge is to convince myself &mdash; beyond reasonable doubt &mdash; that this bird is not a stonechat, which is the commoner bird (though, on balance, less likely at this time of year in this location... which in itself is one of the most important clues in solving any bird identification puzzle).\n\nFaced with such a distant view the most salient features are not the colours and patterns captured in bird books and photographs, but behaviours and general shape, size and \"style\" of the bird &mdash; the notorious, and unfortunately named, _jizz_ that birdwatchers often talk about. The bird was perched midway up a weed stem, grabbing it from the side like a cirque du soleil act. This is not conclusive, but stonechat are far more fond of perching right on top of plants. As the bird flew from plant to plant, not once favouring the weed-top perch, the evidence mounted up.\n\nStonechats are also very bull-headed and upstanding &mdash; one could imagine them in a bowler hat &mdash; whereas whinchats are far sleeker, but possessive of a nervous energy, like an edgy geezer trying to shift some stolen goods on a street corner, looking out for the rozzers. This bird had a definite leaning towards the latter description, but a distant view of an immature bird can lead to all sorts of misunderstandings. Someone could get 'urt.\n\nEventually I managed to pick out a few more details and grew certain in my judgement. It had a clear demarcation between dark folded wings and pale flanks, as if wearing a tailcoat. While neither winchat nor stonechat can match the wheatear's slate grey to pale-buff contrast in this regard, the whinchat is the more contrasting of the two. As better light fell on its head I was also able to make out traces of a pale eyebrow and an orange chin. Not just a whinchat, but a nicely coloured male, though evidently some way into its bedraggling moult.\n\nMoments later &mdash; evidently unimpressed by the level of threat I'd turned out to be &mdash; it flew straight back towards me, veering off to the right only at the last moment and landing a short distance away on the concrete rim of the reservoir. It was indeed a lovely male whinchat, and in far better condition than it'd appeared from a distance. Its wide, bright, bushy eybrow framed its oddly placid, unsevere expression &mdash; a more relaxed bird than the sum of its parts would suggest. \n\nIt scampered ahead of me as I walked on, before eventually flitting over the water in an arc to rejoin the path behind.\n\n\"Well done, son,\" I muttered. \"You did good. Real good.\"\n\nI think I was talking to the bird, but it might just as well have been myself.\n\n[Main image credit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/yeliseev/5909939375/in/photolist-a1eZ5t-6Azhd2-a3zvS1-6Azhd4-a1hRaS-6ADzXy-a3zvTd-8qtpgb-c6nhMu-2ezcATJ-6CDDEa-eQqHCL-6CDDEk-o3dUCx-dUXQsG-ouBLuV-ob2YPK-6CDDD8-v9PXTY-8pJgK3-up5P1r-2g25PxW-2iQZS6N-v4tpPZ-27A2Znh-uuz2C4-vqS5LE-oNnZLS-pKix8h-pKizUQ-YnPbAs-2iUtjB1-22PLB6w-Tt2GsU-QTVEBk-2iUxPVn-TGQwsz-dieSGp-275nG6h-2ghyQ35-2iUxPzT-VRBbrK-Xzgfcy-3aKqPN-2g2hKJh-8K3dEF-4udXCP-gtQWXG-9EkPMR-31b4Us)","src/data/birds/2020-07-18-whinchat.md","156049e9865ddb9c",{"html":1399,"metadata":1400},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/whinchat.jpg\" alt=\"whinchat\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s been a scorching July afternoon, and I joined the hoi-poloi strolling and cycling in sun hats, and picking the earliest ripening blackberries from under the eyes of tut-tutting blackcaps. But if, like me, you’d begun the day at seven, you’d have seen a surprisingly cool and overcast start to the day, more in keeping with October. So the rest of the day was an unexpected outcome.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I go on about the coming of autumn a lot, and there were more signs today. It’s perhaps not so much the comming of autumn but the ending of summer. The birds are, one by one, losing the urge to sing, just as tired old couples can lose the flirtatious spark. Sedge and reed warblers and whitethroats, still filling their respective undergrowth, reedbeds and bushes with their particular variety of rattling just a few weeks ago, have fallen silent. Reed buntings still sing their creaky few notes now and again, but the collcted menagerie of bird life no longer fizzes around the reserve. This gives the classic feel of midsummer birding — the silent hedgerow under the baking sun, the hum of crickets in the dry grass the dominant sound now, and everything needing a drink of water.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some other familiar faces were showing the signs of transitioning to a new stage of life. The juvenile grey wagtail around East Warwick I’ve introduced before now sports a respectably grown up long tail and bright yellow vent feathers, but still gives away its youth by it’s still pinkish legs. A sand martin, changing direction alongside me, fanned its wings and showed it was already moulting. A \u003Ca href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00063658009476656?needAccess=true&#x26;\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit of research\u003C/a> has taught me that mostly they moult in their African wintering quarters, but a tiny minority may start before they leave. I’m enjoying the little details of these orinary birds I’m picking up in these two months of intensive interest-seeking.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And on the tern colony island one of the oldest chicks gave its wings a vigorous flap in preparation for flight in a day or two. I watched a cloud of cantankerous terns wheeling above the inflow pipe on No. 3 reservoir, picking arguments and engaging in minor skirmishes with each other — jostling for the best fishing spot one woudl imagine, although they are in such constant, wheeling motion it hardly seems to matter. Every so often a tern would halt, splay its forked tail (looking like fairy wings) and hover before plunging for a fish and leaving to deliver it to junior. With these repeat close up views of them flying by just above eye level I noticed, for the first time in my life, how cute and pointless their little cartoon legs look in flight, like the nut-holding hands of a squirrel or the legendary useless arms of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/tern-cloud2.jpg\" alt=\"tern-cloud2\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At this watering hole they tolerate — or are tolerated by is likely more accurate — the resident heron most days, but the opposite is far from true. A heron flying above the colony triggered the most virulent flash-mobbing I think I’ve seen yet, with every tern and black-headed gull focusing their energy on repelling the lanky intruder. As my Essex friends might put it, it was “mobbed to shit!”. One tern transformed in an instant from laconically surveying the shallows into heron seeking missile, answering the signal with a powerful, dart-like turn of speed. I also saw an aggressive chase between some grebes.

Returning so early, I wonder if today's birds (I saw a second one later on Lockwood) had any success breeding?\n\nBut now is not really their season. While not rare locally they are a determinedly winter bird, gathering in their dozens around the High Maynard islands, or bobbing about on the River Lea arund Hackney Marshes, where the river is remarkably just about still tidal. Best of all though are their courtship displays in late winter, with males somehow concertinaing their already short bodies into an even shorter space, backcombing their head feathers and fanning their undertail yellow triangle into a bold billboard. They ring-a-ding-ding their dinner bell calls and every few seconds throw a violent little spasm, arching their back, pulling in their neck and flicking out their wings.

Returning so early, I wonder if today’s birds (I saw a second one later on Lockwood) had any success breeding?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But now is not really their season. While not rare locally they are a determinedly winter bird, gathering in their dozens around the High Maynard islands, or bobbing about on the River Lea arund Hackney Marshes, where the river is remarkably just about still tidal. Best of all though are their courtship displays in late winter, with males somehow concertinaing their already short bodies into an even shorter space, backcombing their head feathers and fanning their undertail yellow triangle into a bold billboard. They ring-a-ding-ding their dinner bell calls and every few seconds throw a violent little spasm, arching their back, pulling in their neck and flicking out their wings.

In my teens they had started breeding at the Conwy reserve, which is where I saw my first ever. Further south they're a little more common, but still officially rare and protected. Last year they showed up at the reservoirs throughout the summer, suggesting they bred in some secluded spot nearby.

He wished me luck.\n\nMaybe he's charmed, or maybe my time had come, but either way, the plover didn't put up much resistance. A few steps after sidling around the edge of the ineffective barrier to the public I saw it standing, bobbing nervously, on the carpet of dried algae at the water's edge. \n\nIt's legs are so slender, like the drainpipe jeaned legs of the decade past's Shoreditch hipsters, and often with one leg held bent at the knee, with swooning poise. This look somehow pervades the juvenile's entire body; slightly scaly faun back, cap and neckerchief, and a faint cream eye ring in place of oversize granny shades. Far cooler than the adults which, with black collars and striking yellow monacles, are a bit try-hard if you ask me.\n\nIt got nervous and flew around me, back to where the fisherman's line lassooed back and too on its mission to put a tempting needlework fly in some trout's path. I climbed back around the fence &mdash; more cautiously this time &mdash; and sat down on one of the galvanized steel platforms of indeterminate purpose to watch it scamper, tilt and peck along the strandline. Ten minutes of my life I'll never get back, but I think I can live with that. As I walked away a trout jumped clear out of the water. I wondered if our fisherman's luck would extend to his own fortunes.\n\nWondering back along East Warwick a recently fledged tern, wings of roughly cut paper rather than the grown-ups' delicately fringed lace, circled noisily. It hadn't quite figured out how to tuck its legs in yet and they both dangled like a set of stabilisers on a child's bike.

Nor did I plan to today, but a particularly sound night's sleep followed by a thoroughly bright and early awakening meant it was an inevitability.\n\nOnly a few paces inside the reserve gates I was greeted by two kingfishers bombing across from the River Lea to Coppermill Stream. They don't look half as fast, nor as colourful, flying in front of the open greenery as they do when shooting along above a dark and glossy river. Nonetheless, two kingfishers is a great start to a morning's birding.\n\nAt East Warwick about a dozen swift honoured me with their presence, a densely packed mob of coots menaced a corner of the island, and a common sandpiper rose up ahead of me to flick its way over the water to safety. A little further along I was pleased, and a little dismayed, to flush a green sandpiper. Like the common sandpiper's less uptight younger sibling it flew with far looser beats of its dark wings, looking twice the size as a result. It rose up, up and away flashing its white rump as it disappeared off into the clouds. \n\nOn I went down to No. 5, spotting a male sparrowhawk cruising the poplars on the way. Arriving at the water's edge my phone vibrated to announce that a turnstone had just flown down to inspect East Warwick island, made a couple of disapproving circuits and departed immediately. A minute earlier and I would have seen it, not only a new patch tick for me, but also among my favourite birds. Birdwatching is a cruel hobby sometimes. They tell you about the dizzying highs, but not about the crushing lows. Kids &mdash; Just. Say. NO!\n\nNever mind. I'm sure I won't have spent the next twenty minutes cursing to myself, will I. \n\nTo be fair, I did still enjoy a brief view of a green woodpecker, the still approachable and dinky little ringed plover, and even the macabre sight of the pint-sized corpse of a shelduckling. And the one that got away spurred me on to sit by the lakeside and wait in the sun for something else good to pass by. The number of swifts in the sky grew moderately and a little reed warbler subsong emanated from over by the fisherman's hut in a gentle requiem for spring.\n\nThis idyllic scene lasted about twenty minutes before Chris paged again &mdash; his luck (and patience, skill, eyesight etc.. ) &mdash; are in at the moment. I hadn't taken the time to visit the far south corner of East Warwick, but from here it was apparently just possible to see a **Dunlin** on the other side of the railway tracks, feeding on the concrete beach that graces West Warwick's south end.\n\nA few minutes later I was there, staring acros at a little speck of bird cowering beneath a tall weed. It was no turnstone, no honourable self-found bird, and not even a decent view, but it was at least a patch tick. I calculated I didn't have time to walk around and get back home before work started in earnest, so accepted that the morning's birding was over, and left others to feast their eyes on the remaining highlight of the morning. \n\nA feather in my figurative bird-listing cap, but it didn't feel good. It didn't feel good at all.\n\n...\n\nEvening, and twenty woodpigeons &mdash; a notable flock &mdash; scarper as I approach Lockwod. A few sand martin weave southward, and a good smattering of gulls gives character to the expanse of water. Small groups of cormorants propel themselves home to roost, arrayed in straight lines and wings beating steadily like a wind farm. \n\nAs I follow them south down the last stretch of the reservoir-side path I come across a group of canada geese, and all but one of them panic and fly away. The one left behind is still mid-moult and yet to regain its powers of flight. It bundles itself over the low brick wall and into the water. It's a scene of such tragicomic brilliance that I almost cry with laughter. I think we can all empathise with that goose's fate. Less though the recently killed body of another goose I find abandoned (temporarily I assume) by a fox I startle. It does pay to be able to fly.\n\nThe birding not being outstanding I consider that it will only take five minutes to cycle to the south end of the reserve and check out its more hospitable lakes again. As I get within striking distance of the far corner of East Warwick I consider... no, it can't be... but no harm in checking... no, it _won't_ be... but, but... but it _is!_.\n\nRemarkably the dunlin stayed all day (normally, I'm told, they pass through very briefly, unless they're properly grounded by foul weather). I get on my bike and cycle up, under and down the railway verge. I'm not 100% sure whether that's in breach of the conditions of my permit, but it hardly seems important right now.\n\nClimbing up the bank of West Warwick I keep a low profile and sit on the grass. I look up and down the concrete shelf climbing out of the water, but all I see are ducks and several vaguely bird-shaped agglomerations of stones and weeds. It can't have been a trick of the light... can it?\n\nEventually a bird appears... but it's a common sandpiper. Surely not. It was... it was smaller... and it looked like a dark smudge underneath... and there was no bright white to speak of &mdash; I would've noticed... and I saw a longer beak... did I? Or... _did_ I?\n\nUnsatisfied with the diagnosis I obtained a second opinion from Dr. Edge A. Little-Klosse. The departure of a couple of resting tufted ducks (sorry) revealed what I'd known/hoped/imagined/prayed all along &mdash; there, a foot from the shore, stood a well turned out adult dunlin, palm-of-your-hand small, but with a long, droopy-sad, black beak giving it the gravitas of a much bigger bird. I edged closer still, marvelling at this bird's tameness, savouring its parochial behaviour as it, in turn, savoured whatever foodstuffs it was managing to fish from the shallows.\n\nAnd that, I'm afraid, is all the description you'll get of it &mdash; it's getting late, and this isn't a blog about birds, is it &mdash; it's a blog about birdwatching. Sod the dunlin. Have this portrait of my obsessive behaviour instead. \n\n![bike rest](/assets/img/bike-rest.jpg)","src/data/birds/2020-07-23-dunlin.md","77e3abf7eab41c25",{"html":1523,"metadata":1524},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/dunlin.jpg\" alt=\"dunlin\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Busy mornings and sleepless nights meant I hadn’t seen the early morning reservoirs for several days.

It rose up, up and away flashing its white rump as it disappeared off into the clouds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On I went down to No. 5, spotting a male sparrowhawk cruising the poplars on the way. Arriving at the water’s edge my phone vibrated to announce that a turnstone had just flown down to inspect East Warwick island, made a couple of disapproving circuits and departed immediately. A minute earlier and I would have seen it, not only a new patch tick for me, but also among my favourite birds. Birdwatching is a cruel hobby sometimes. They tell you about the dizzying highs, but not about the crushing lows. Kids — Just. Say. NO!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Never mind. I’m sure I won’t have spent the next twenty minutes cursing to myself, will I.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To be fair, I did still enjoy a brief view of a green woodpecker, the still approachable and dinky little ringed plover, and even the macabre sight of the pint-sized corpse of a shelduckling. And the one that got away spurred me on to sit by the lakeside and wait in the sun for something else good to pass by. The number of swifts in the sky grew moderately and a little reed warbler subsong emanated from over by the fisherman’s hut in a gentle requiem for spring.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This idyllic scene lasted about twenty minutes before Chris paged again — his luck (and patience, skill, eyesight etc.. ) — are in at the moment. I hadn’t taken the time to visit the far south corner of East Warwick, but from here it was apparently just possible to see a \u003Cstrong>Dunlin\u003C/strong> on the other side of the railway tracks, feeding on the concrete beach that graces West Warwick’s south end.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A few minutes later I was there, staring acros at a little speck of bird cowering beneath a tall weed. It was no turnstone, no honourable self-found bird, and not even a decent view, but it was at least a patch tick. I calculated I didn’t have time to walk around and get back home before work started in earnest, so accepted that the morning’s birding was over, and left others to feast their eyes on the remaining highlight of the morning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A feather in my figurative bird-listing cap, but it didn’t feel good. It didn’t feel good at all.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Evening, and twenty woodpigeons — a notable flock — scarper as I approach Lockwod. A few sand martin weave southward, and a good smattering of gulls gives character to the expanse of water. Small groups of cormorants propel themselves home to roost, arrayed in straight lines and wings beating steadily like a wind farm.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As I follow them south down the last stretch of the reservoir-side path I come across a group of canada geese, and all but one of them panic and fly away. The one left behind is still mid-moult and yet to regain its powers of flight. It bundles itself over the low brick wall and into the water. It’s a scene of such tragicomic brilliance that I almost cry with laughter. I think we can all empathise with that goose’s fate. Less though the recently killed body of another goose I find abandoned (temporarily I assume) by a fox I startle. It does pay to be able to fly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The birding not being outstanding I consider that it will only take five minutes to cycle to the south end of the reserve and check out its more hospitable lakes again. As I get within striking distance of the far corner of East Warwick I consider… no, it can’t be… but no harm in checking… no, it \u003Cem>won’t\u003C/em> be… but, but… but it \u003Cem>is!\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Remarkably the dunlin stayed all day (normally, I’m told, they pass through very briefly, unless they’re properly grounded by foul weather). I get on my bike and cycle up, under and down the railway verge. I’m not 100% sure whether that’s in breach of the conditions of my permit, but it hardly seems important right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Climbing up the bank of West Warwick I keep a low profile and sit on the grass. I look up and down the concrete shelf climbing out of the water, but all I see are ducks and several vaguely bird-shaped agglomerations of stones and weeds. It can’t have been a trick of the light… can it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eventually a bird appears… but it’s a common sandpiper. Surely not. It was… it was smaller… and it looked like a dark smudge underneath… and there was no bright white to speak of — I would’ve noticed… and I saw a longer beak… did I? Or… \u003Cem>did\u003C/em> I?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unsatisfied with the diagnosis I obtained a second opinion from Dr. Edge A. Little-Klosse. The departure of a couple of resting tufted ducks (sorry) revealed what I’d known/hoped/imagined/prayed all along — there, a foot from the shore, stood a well turned out adult dunlin, palm-of-your-hand small, but with a long, droopy-sad, black beak giving it the gravitas of a much bigger bird. I edged closer still, marvelling at this bird’s tameness, savouring its parochial behaviour as it, in turn, savoured whatever foodstuffs it was managing to fish from the shallows.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that, I’m afraid, is all the description you’ll get of it — it’s getting late, and this isn’t a blog about birds, is it — it’s a blog about birdwatching. Sod the dunlin.

Too few notes to really tell, it made me think that perhaps my first willow warbler of the autumn was around. I heard a chiffchaff's clear tiny-blacksmith chiming from the treetops too, and wondered if I was just listening to a single confused chiffchaff &mdash; they are closely related and do apparently sometimes mimmick one another, though this is not something I've knowingly come across.\n\n\u003Caudio controls>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/willow-chiff.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\u003C/audio>\n\nIt wasn't long before I'd set eyes on both birds though. The chiffchaff clambering about on the tips of the willows' twigs, and the willow warbler moving, and singing, far more hesitantly through the tangled branches of a rosehip bush. As willow warblers don't breed within London as a rule it's not frequently I get to compare them side by side, but looking at them both today I was struck by how I _can_ now tell these very similar birds apart by sight alone. I was previously of the \"never sure unless I hear it\" camp, but now I think I'd have a pretty decent hit rate of identifying them even with their mouths closed. I'll leave explaining why to their respective blog posts though.\n\nA shower of long-tailed tits descended like a mist, with some settling in the dry weeds at my feet for a while. They really are the cutest little creatures. Why Disney or McDonalds haven't clocked this is a mystery to me. The franchising opportunities alone must be worth billions.\n\nA little further along, next to the towering central pylon, I heard a few **Cetti's Warblers** singing in close proximity to one another. Someone once told me that this late in the season the singing is a mixture of juveniles practicing and parents trying to drive their children out of their territory. They are notoriously aggressive singers &mdash; a good mnemonic is to imagine them as football hooligans yelling \"I'm a f**king Cetti's Warbler, yes I f**king am!\". Their a delight to hear the odd burst of, but a persistent tirade would probably drive me out of house and home too.\n\nCetti's warblers are, like little egrets, ring-necked parakeets and goldfinches, one of those birds whose star has risen during my lifetime. They are all far commoner now than when I was a teenager. On a brief stop off at Radipole Lake in Weymouth _en route_ to Guernsey for a family holiday I remember breeding cetti's warblers being one of the star attractions of this southerly reserve. But their range now stretches up at least as far Lancashire. A couple of years ago, just prior to the \"Beast from the East\" late winter freeze, I came across a wintering bird at Ynys Hir in West Wales, identifying it by its subdued _chiup chiup_ calls rather than the more recognisable, ballsy song.\n\nThey have been common in London for a long time. I think I came across my first ever at the Waterworks in about 2006, drawing the not unreasonable conclusion that the ridiculously clear, loud and aggressive song coming from some unseen bird in the undergrowth coudl _only_ be made by the bird that every field guide describes as skulking but noisy. More often than not aiting for it to show itself is a futile exercise &mdash; they have no need for coming out in the open, so why should they &mdash; but on that occasion I was eventually rewarded with a few glimpses.\n\nToday I was far luckier. In fact, this time of year is probably the best for seeing them as there are so many young birds about, as yet unschooled in the skulk and shout ways of its people. Nearing the end of the central path some characteristic _chiup_ing emanated from the pathside gorse bushes, together with a more insipid begging call from a dense blackthorn. A little patience and, one by one, three very young warblers perched out in the open. \n\nEven more featureless than the adults, they were still unmistakably cetti's. Yet another milk-choclatey brown bird, they do have a warmer reddish tint and a faint pale stripe above the eyes to liven it up a little. Below they are unadventurous beige (I thought I detected a hint of streaking on these young birds too). What does mark them out visually is their sprightly, cocked long tail, and an overall alert, martial demeanour, like the hairpin-trigger commander of a guerrilla unit. The youngsters were so fresh their tails hadn't yet grown to this pocket-sized peacock length, and they appeared fresh-faced and timid. And yet, still less passsive and bumbling than most other birds their age.\n\nI finished my walk, failing to find the garganey or redstart of my dreams, but consoling myself with the comical, angry birds lookalike of a male pied wagtail who'd lost his tail. It could still just about fly though.","src/data/birds/2020-07-26-cettis-warbler.md","9551764421d36e57",{"html":1565,"metadata":1566},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/cettis-warbler.jpg\" alt=\"cetti&#x27;s warbler\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not every morning can be as full of drama as \u003Ca href=\"/2020/07/23/dunlin.html\">three days ago\u003C/a> but after a night of torrential rain I had high hopes that today would be another morning of recovering downed waders, with perhaps a bedraggled migrating songbird or two drying in the bushes.

I wonder if anybody has ever considered using them to improve the accuracy of our navigational devices?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the central path, in search of either a garganey on the water or a redstart in the bushes — not too much to ask for, surely — I paused on hearing an indistinct few flutey notes that sounded a little too soft and open to be a blackcap’s inconsequential practice noodling. Too few notes to really tell, it made me think that perhaps my first willow warbler of the autumn was around. I heard a chiffchaff’s clear tiny-blacksmith chiming from the treetops too, and wondered if I was just listening to a single confused chiffchaff — they are closely related and do apparently sometimes mimmick one another, though this is not something I’ve knowingly come across.\u003C/p>\n\u003Caudio controls>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/willow-chiff.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\u003C/audio>\n\u003Cp>It wasn’t long before I’d set eyes on both birds though. The chiffchaff clambering about on the tips of the willows’ twigs, and the willow warbler moving, and singing, far more hesitantly through the tangled branches of a rosehip bush. As willow warblers don’t breed within London as a rule it’s not frequently I get to compare them side by side, but looking at them both today I was struck by how I \u003Cem>can\u003C/em> now tell these very similar birds apart by sight alone. I was previously of the “never sure unless I hear it” camp, but now I think I’d have a pretty decent hit rate of identifying them even with their mouths closed. I’ll leave explaining why to their respective blog posts though.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A shower of long-tailed tits descended like a mist, with some settling in the dry weeds at my feet for a while. They really are the cutest little creatures. Why Disney or McDonalds haven’t clocked this is a mystery to me. The franchising opportunities alone must be worth billions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A little further along, next to the towering central pylon, I heard a few \u003Cstrong>Cetti’s Warblers\u003C/strong> singing in close proximity to one another. Someone once told me that this late in the season the singing is a mixture of juveniles practicing and parents trying to drive their children out of their territory. They are notoriously aggressive singers — a good mnemonic is to imagine them as football hooligans yelling “I’m a f\u003Cstrong>king Cetti’s Warbler, yes I f\u003C/strong>king am!”. Their a delight to hear the odd burst of, but a persistent tirade would probably drive me out of house and home too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cetti’s warblers are, like little egrets, ring-necked parakeets and goldfinches, one of those birds whose star has risen during my lifetime. They are all far commoner now than when I was a teenager. On a brief stop off at Radipole Lake in Weymouth \u003Cem>en route\u003C/em> to Guernsey for a family holiday I remember breeding cetti’s warblers being one of the star attractions of this southerly reserve. But their range now stretches up at least as far Lancashire. A couple of years ago, just prior to the “Beast from the East” late winter freeze, I came across a wintering bird at Ynys Hir in West Wales, identifying it by its subdued \u003Cem>chiup chiup\u003C/em> calls rather than the more recognisable, ballsy song.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They have been common in London for a long time. I think I came across my first ever at the Waterworks in about 2006, drawing the not unreasonable conclusion that the ridiculously clear, loud and aggressive song coming from some unseen bird in the undergrowth coudl \u003Cem>only\u003C/em> be made by the bird that every field guide describes as skulking but noisy. More often than not aiting for it to show itself is a futile exercise — they have no need for coming out in the open, so why should they — but on that occasion I was eventually rewarded with a few glimpses.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Today I was far luckier. In fact, this time of year is probably the best for seeing them as there are so many young birds about, as yet unschooled in the skulk and shout ways of its people. Nearing the end of the central path some characteristic _chiup_ing emanated from the pathside gorse bushes, together with a more insipid begging call from a dense blackthorn. A little patience and, one by one, three very young warblers perched out in the open.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Even more featureless than the adults, they were still unmistakably cetti’s. Yet another milk-choclatey brown bird, they do have a warmer reddish tint and a faint pale stripe above the eyes to liven it up a little. Below they are unadventurous beige (I thought I detected a hint of streaking on these young birds too). What does mark them out visually is their sprightly, cocked long tail, and an overall alert, martial demeanour, like the hairpin-trigger commander of a guerrilla unit. The youngsters were so fresh their tails hadn’t yet grown to this pocket-sized peacock length, and they appeared fresh-faced and timid. And yet, still less passsive and bumbling than most other birds their age.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I finished my walk, failing to find the garganey or redstart of my dreams, but consoling myself with the comical, angry birds lookalike of a male pied wagtail who’d lost his tail.

And wonder, as do I, why there were no swifts, which were quite abundant earlier in the day.\n\nOther highlight of the day? Well, it _was_ supposed to be an influx of migratory songbirds. The first day in a while with a northerly wind, albeit a soft one, which might tempt more of them to begin their journeys south and pop in to London on the way. At Woodberry Wetlands, just a few miles away, there were apparently dozens of willow warblers, but despite my best efforts, Walthamstow had no more than yesterday. Possibly even fewer.\n\nWhat there were, however, were a number of **Chiffchaffs** giving me the run around. My ability to clearly distinguish when something is definitely a chiffchaff is inversely proportional to how much I'd liek it to be something else &mdash; I'm only human. So this morning they teased me, like bashful little ventriloquists, throwing thir sweeet little _hueet_ calls out of the bushes with just enough of a disyllabic hint to confuse me into believeing it a willow warbler. Followed by a stakeout ending in a glimpse of a blackish shin, greyish back, habitually dipped tail or loss of faith in the integrity of the call, any of which led me reluctantly home to a positive classification as a chiffchaff.\n\nNot that the chiffchaff is a bad bird. In fact, it's a rather good one. Its song used to be one of the earliest harbingers of spring proper, being a summer migrant that starts arriving and singing in early March. Nowadays, in the south of England at least, they winter here in high enough numbers (birds from germany apparently) that the songs start even earlier, although there is still a pleasing influx that hits towards the end of the month, and consistently brightens any woodland, rather than the relative few that shelter a wintering bird or too.\n\nAnd what a song it is. Not showboaty, or even particularly musical, but like so many other simple birdsongs, has the power to evoke the clear air of spring. Two (or sometimes three) slightly differently pitched sweet high notes repeated in a steady cadence, it's also the bird most likely to be confused with a metronome. Whoever named it the chiffchaff must not have been very observant as, though the pace is extremely steady, they very rarely alternate between the two pitches, and are more likely to sing a _chiff chiff chaff chaff_ than a simple _chiff chaff_. \n\nWalking about the reservoirs this morning I eventually sat by the woodpile by the fisherman's hut to wait for the warblers to materialise. Lots of chaffinches again (the similarity to the chiffchaff's name is coincidental &mdash; the chaff in chaffinch refers to the detritus of wheat production), and a couple of young robins, one of them flushing a little orange, and both practicing the territorial muscles the species is well known for (one of the few species to regularly fight to the death). A number of reed warblers flitted about, with a blackcap &mdash; very much the daddy of the warblers &mdash; bossing them about. But no glimpse of a willow wrabler, nor even the chiffchaff who can often be seen creeping about like a mouse.\n\nEventually I hear a willow warbler singing from the other side of the hut. I walk over to see if I can find it, but my patience is waning and my stomach appeals for breakfast. Where I'm stood, I'm keeping the goldfinches from their thistles too, and I sympathise with their hunger, so I head for home, coming across a cantankerous little toadlet on the way.\n\n![toadlet](/assets/img/toadlet.jpg)\n\n[Main image credit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hedera_baltica/49896893691/in/photolist-2j2dC7x-2iTKeTC-2jfpWT5-2gBWmsU-2hpRQWH-29eSjpb-XC28pn-2eprvVE-YUe6Rp-267oyZd-WSXcwb-25cfpA1-X2XZHJ-2grvqDU-25RsEoo-SnmBx7-2j1XcgT-eMQCgU-2jpUTwf-2gcuQPo-mXMFmv-2cakmDU-RPtK3c-2jmySZG-KSksqG-2iGYdUt-W4kXhk-VcbiLX-2iNk3PK-XjAjJZ-TJ2WCg-2iNRRsL-Uiu2mE-bti3Df-31guG3-bFRLrg-2Uyyst-2iGZivq-7PyFSk-7PCEmf-7T4hb8-7PyFL4-7T4h7i-Grtu8e-2iH1D1i-2iZWCHg-2jp2s47-2iHiWgc-2eoFBAM-2eaf3uV)","src/data/birds/2020-07-29-chiffchaff.md","7a28350db4831e2f",{"html":1605,"metadata":1606},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/chiffchaff.jpg\" alt=\"chiffchaff\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I sit writing this with the grazed elbows of a tumble off the bike, so it will probably be brief.

And wonder, as do I, why there were no swifts, which were quite abundant earlier in the day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Other highlight of the day? Well, it \u003Cem>was\u003C/em> supposed to be an influx of migratory songbirds. The first day in a while with a northerly wind, albeit a soft one, which might tempt more of them to begin their journeys south and pop in to London on the way. At Woodberry Wetlands, just a few miles away, there were apparently dozens of willow warblers, but despite my best efforts, Walthamstow had no more than yesterday. Possibly even fewer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What there were, however, were a number of \u003Cstrong>Chiffchaffs\u003C/strong> giving me the run around. My ability to clearly distinguish when something is definitely a chiffchaff is inversely proportional to how much I’d liek it to be something else — I’m only human. So this morning they teased me, like bashful little ventriloquists, throwing thir sweeet little \u003Cem>hueet\u003C/em> calls out of the bushes with just enough of a disyllabic hint to confuse me into believeing it a willow warbler. Followed by a stakeout ending in a glimpse of a blackish shin, greyish back, habitually dipped tail or loss of faith in the integrity of the call, any of which led me reluctantly home to a positive classification as a chiffchaff.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not that the chiffchaff is a bad bird. In fact, it’s a rather good one. Its song used to be one of the earliest harbingers of spring proper, being a summer migrant that starts arriving and singing in early March. Nowadays, in the south of England at least, they winter here in high enough numbers (birds from germany apparently) that the songs start even earlier, although there is still a pleasing influx that hits towards the end of the month, and consistently brightens any woodland, rather than the relative few that shelter a wintering bird or too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what a song it is. Not showboaty, or even particularly musical, but like so many other simple birdsongs, has the power to evoke the clear air of spring. Two (or sometimes three) slightly differently pitched sweet high notes repeated in a steady cadence, it’s also the bird most likely to be confused with a metronome. Whoever named it the chiffchaff must not have been very observant as, though the pace is extremely steady, they very rarely alternate between the two pitches, and are more likely to sing a \u003Cem>chiff chiff chaff chaff\u003C/em> than a simple \u003Cem>chiff chaff\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Walking about the reservoirs this morning I eventually sat by the woodpile by the fisherman’s hut to wait for the warblers to materialise. Lots of chaffinches again (the similarity to the chiffchaff’s name is coincidental — the chaff in chaffinch refers to the detritus of wheat production), and a couple of young robins, one of them flushing a little orange, and both practicing the territorial muscles the species is well known for (one of the few species to regularly fight to the death). A number of reed warblers flitted about, with a blackcap — very much the daddy of the warblers — bossing them about. But no glimpse of a willow wrabler, nor even the chiffchaff who can often be seen creeping about like a mouse.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eventually I hear a willow warbler singing from the other side of the hut. I walk over to see if I can find it, but my patience is waning and my stomach appeals for breakfast. Where I’m stood, I’m keeping the goldfinches from their thistles too, and I sympathise with their hunger, so I head for home, coming across a cantankerous little toadlet on the way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/toadlet.jpg\" alt=\"toadlet\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/hedera_baltica/49896893691/in/photolist-2j2dC7x-2iTKeTC-2jfpWT5-2gBWmsU-2hpRQWH-29eSjpb-XC28pn-2eprvVE-YUe6Rp-267oyZd-WSXcwb-25cfpA1-X2XZHJ-2grvqDU-25RsEoo-SnmBx7-2j1XcgT-eMQCgU-2jpUTwf-2gcuQPo-mXMFmv-2cakmDU-RPtK3c-2jmySZG-KSksqG-2iGYdUt-W4kXhk-VcbiLX-2iNk3PK-XjAjJZ-TJ2WCg-2iNRRsL-Uiu2mE-bti3Df-31guG3-bFRLrg-2Uyyst-2iGZivq-7PyFSk-7PCEmf-7T4hb8-7PyFL4-7T4h7i-Grtu8e-2iH1D1i-2iZWCHg-2jp2s47-2iHiWgc-2eoFBAM-2eaf3uV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Main image credit\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":1607,"localImagePaths":1608,"remoteImagePaths":1609,"frontmatter":1610,"imagePaths":1613},[],[],[],{"layout":27,"title":1597,"description":1599,"primaryTag":522,"tags":1611,"date":1612},[629,715,418,413,417,522,742,521,493,495,1560,494],["Date","2020-07-29T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2020-07-28-great-black-backed-gull",{"id":1614,"data":1616,"body":1621,"filePath":1622,"digest":1623,"rendered":1624},{"title":1617,"date":1618,"description":1619,"primaryTag":743,"tags":1620},"61 Boring Birds: #58 Great black-backed gull",["Date","2020-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"],"Holding all of the ocean",[1560,522,367,742,919,854,672,543,441,494,743,715,368,496],"![gbbg](/assets/img/gbbg.jpg)\n\nThe sun, freshly peeled by the brisk wind, radiated in the sky this morning, though did not carry enough warmth to overcome the decidedly autumnal feel.

Two greylag geese stand the other side to welcome me. They wave tiny union jack flags on sticks.\n\n![hello-sky](/assets/img/hello-sky.jpg)\n\nCoots and a large contingency of tufted ducks await me on Lockwood, with a few swans once more tending the flock. Down on High Maynard I watch two grebes exchange the gift of a fish. They've been active around their nest for some time, but are both off it and in the water today, so perhaps there are no eggs yet. Or the eggs have been taken.\n\nThe breeze stiffens considerably as I near the top end of the lake. Two common sandpipers fly up form the bank. The first, in a blind panic, lets the wind accelerate it up, away, and onwards up the overflow channel some twenty metres below, whie the other calmly turns into the wind and manoeuvres itself slowly and precisely, like a remote controlled drone, back to a feeding spot a little out of my reach. It looks so tiny and toylike against the massive, swollen mood of the heavy sky. Some egrets crouch nervously in the shade of a fallen log as a few spits of rain begin to fall.\n\nAnd that's as far as the drama goes. The cloud just playing, and it slowly turns off the wind faucet, and enters into a chaotic, colourful dance around the colour palette for the rest of the evening. Leaving me to concentrate on one final day of birds. Beginning with another failed attempt to find a yellow-legged gull (though being sure I didn't find one is perhaps still a kind of success?)... and then on to the south side of the reserve.\n\nI almost tread on a dunnock walking up the central path &mdash; \"almost tread on\" is something easy to say flippantly and not meant to be taken literally, but I really did almost squish the foolish little thing! Further along I come across a copule of juvenile robins, one of them sporting a little red on its breast. I wonder how many have bred here this year? I've been seeing birds in this mid-moult plummage for at least a month, and it can't last all that long. I feel guilty for not featuring them on the blog in full as they are a disarming mix of cocky, cantankerous adult and naive youngster. Well, at least they've had a few good mentions.\n\nAt the south end of the path I stop by the bridge at the bottom corner of No. 3. The sun breaks through the clouds behind me and paints a lime green and purple ink scene withe the willows, the sky and its reflection. A tern in a hurry races towards me in slow motion, as if directed by Michael Bay, and, unlike in his films, makes the moment sublimely beautiful. On the centre of the lake the still growing shelducklings upend for food, a black-headed gull circles amiably, and a few freshly hatched black tufted ducklings decorate the scene with a last taste of spring. A moorhen submerges itself behind a lily pad to hide from me, but I see its red and yellow beak poking out among the duckweed.\n\n![tern-glade](/assets/img/tern-glade.jpg)\n\nRounding the corner I notice that there are ripe elderberries on a few of the bushes &mdash; at the beginning of the blog they would still have been in flower. As if to reenforce the message that there's a new season in town, and its name is autumn, and summer better watch its back, I stumble into my first really significant warbler flock of the year. It's likely that the group of at least fifteen chiffchaffs &mdash; mixed with various tits and a few blackcaps and chaffinches &mdsah; will have flown in together from somewhere further north. I can't back this up, but migratory flocks' behaviour generally seems freer than birds that spent the summer here, who have held territories, know the lie of the land, and have developed skulking habits suited to the local human and predator demographics. \n\nMigratory flocks, by contrast, seem to leave all their self-preservatory inhibitions back at the ranch, and descend to bounce around like children in a ballpark. I was treated to some flybys of chiffchaffs about as close as my many joyous run-ins with swifts earlier this summer, and really got to examine their surprisingly long, forked tails and other details at close hand. I noticed a few of them had a warm, buffish tinge on their breasts too, slightly different to the duller, cool tones the local birds tend to display. Maybe this is a sign of a more avanced moult, rather than any great generic difference though.\n\nNo willow warbler among them &mdash had their been, it would be the subject of today's blog &mdash; and I think to myself, \"What if I don't choose just one bird today? No one's making me. No one puts Rhys in the corner. F**k you, I won't do what you tell me. All for one and one for all. I am not a number. Liberte, egalite, farternite. I'm Spartacus.\" What if today's blog paints, in broad strokes, a picture of the birdlife of the reservoirs, as a final tribute to the variety that it contains. A tribute to all those there was no time to mention in the acceptance speech. A more fitting end I cannot imagine.\n\nSo I walk on to East Warwick, observing all with the fond eye of a holiday maker on their last evening in the tropical paradise. At the galvanised steel jetty the protective black-headed gull lifts up into the air once more and broadcasts a call which acts as a reprimand to me and a warning to its one remaining chick to float itself out into the open water behind the protective cordon of the coots' aggression. It really is a survivor, but does not appear to be growing very quickly. I hope it makes it through this challenging childhood having taken strength from its experiences.\n\nI'm dive-bombed by a herring gull that seems motivated more by guarding its perch than out of concern for any youngsters' wellbeing, and desists once I move on to a point closer to the island but further from its favourite post. Looking at the island through binoculars I see an ungainly grebe settling on its nest, evidently disorientated by the absence of water to support its body and give it grace. I also see what turns out to be a common sandpiper (they are getting fairly numerous again), but it holds me in \"which wader is it?\" suspense for just long enough that I deem it worth checking every last beach of the reserve for any others that may have landed and be settling down to roost, and so head up the path to the south west corner of the lake. \n\n![gull-dive-bomb](/assets/img/gull-dive-bomb.jpg)\n\nAlong the way I come across a male **Reed Bunting** calling from the top of a reed stem. I forget my previous commitment to fraternite and decide to make it today's star. It's been runner up many times over the summer (more than I've mentioned here), but pipped at the post by the last minute appearance of a hobby, a curlew or &mdash; insult of insults &mdash; the _non-appearance_ of a lesser witethroat.\n\nIt doesn't sing today. No series of creaky whistles with a dropped tin can flourish at the end. Its black hood and bib is also showing the early signs of autumn moult. For a few short months it has been the most well dressed man in the reeds, but soon the crisp pattern will have faded &mdash; particularly at the seams &mdash; and it will be just another little brown job. I do recall, as a child, we'd very occasionally, during the coldest spells, get one feeding in the garden, longer tailed and shorter legged than the other birds, as if someone had injected 10% blobfish genes into a sparrow.\n\nIt keeps calling and as I continue along the path, drawing gradually closer, the four family members it has been warning fly across to West Warwick, with papa taking up the rear. At least the third family I've seen this year, so quite a good breeding season.\n\nFrom the top corner of East Warwick I look across to West Warick and get a glimpse of a couple of smallish ducks with fairly pointy tails upending in the shallows. Could they be a couple of garganey? It's just about getting to the time when they would start passing through. Too distant and semi-obscured from here I turn tails and power-walk towards the tunnel beneath the railway &mdash; the final showdown of the season is afoot.\n\nParakeets fly overhead as I leave the tunnel, funneling over to the canal, from where they will make their way south to the communal roost. It is getting late, and under the heavy, proto-storm clouds it feels later. But not a violent, apocalyptic, end of days darkness &mdash; the sun glows warmly through the thinning portions, and makes a frieze of the few veils of drizzle dripping over distant boroughs. It is the romantic gloaming of romantic poetry, and on its warm breeze brings a sense of satisfaction and wholeness.\n\nI arrive at the south of the reservoir and the ducks reveal themselves to be gadwall, of which there are in fact five (which would be a truly remarkable number, were they garaganey). Never mind &mdash; the thrill of the chase was, as it always is, a tonic. A few juvenile moorhens potter about too, as well as two linnets, two little grebes and two egyptian geese lining up fro their place in Walthamstow's ark. I hear a familiar grating call and 2 sand martins whizz on board. Up above I hear a screech and there &mdash; not wanting to be left out of the grand finale &mdash; is a lone swift, reminding me that it made this town, this town would be nothing without it, and if I think this town has a future without it... fugeddaboutit.\n\nThe sky by now is an enchanting and deranged explosion of inkblot washes on wet paper, and the foreground settles into premature twilght. As if on cue, a capoeira group strikes up in nearby Markfield Park and its dirgey drums and gourds just about complement the dialling down day and its ever retreating chorus of birds. I disturb woodpigeons trying to roost from every bush I pass and properly silhouetted canada geese fly in low to skid to a stop close to their island base. The same dive-bombing herring gull puts in a repeat performance, but over the course of the hour has transformed from white knight to silhouetted watchman. The drums mingle with its calls and, again, I feel the happy pang of the last evening of a perfect holiday. But time to go home.\n\nThese birds are boring anyway.\n\n\u003Caudio controls>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/capoeira-evensong.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\u003C/audio>\n\n![gull-drama](/assets/img/gull-drama.jpg)\n\n. . .\n\nP.S.

What a thought! Freedom from _birdwatching_!\n\nFreedom relished, I ventured out &mdash; force of habit &mdash; at 6 to see if anything had materialised on Lockwood. I looked forward to not noting it down and not finding interesting images with which to describe it. Nevertheless, a few lines found their way past the imperial guards of my fingers:\n- Black water under cloud\n- Chain of tufted duck\n- Peregrine's flappy, flick-winged flight\n\nOut towards Tottenham's football ground, returning this morning midway up the engine house pylon, plucking a pigeon while another &mdash; most likely its chick &mdash; looked on, screeching, from a few struts up. \n\nHighlight of the morning so far, following a slow circumnavigation of Lockwood. Arriving at 7.15 I trotted along until I caught David and Dave, then slowed to their sedate amble. The skies devoid of swifts, we counted linnets (30), starlings (40), egrets and common sandpipers (around 8 of each) and made desultory attempts to pick out yellow-legged gulls among the mid-reservoir flock. Twice I was fooled by waterside lumps of mud taking on the horizontal teardrop shape of a sleeping wader's body.\n\n![dunlin2](/assets/img/dunlin2.jpg)\n\nPerhaps the previous evening's successes had given me a little too much succour. A juvenile dunlin of my very own cowering in the lea of the meshed rock wall poking out from Lockwood's receded water. The lake had clearly left plenty of food behind in the thick strand line of fetid algae. I watched my dunlin find and tuck in to morsel after muddy morsel. Wondering on, I frightened a redshank into fleeing across the water.\n\nTwo of the less frequent waders in one sitting. Lockwood can be an inconstant host, but with 'edges' like that, definitely worth a repeat visit in the morning.\n\nAs Eugene approached we, like police around a cordon, conveyed the disappointing news that there was nothing to see. Aside from a blackcap and the nervous alarm calls of skittish common sandpipers, very little to hear either. \n\nWe walked on, past the aforementioned peregrine and up the central path, where a woodpigeon, by dint of a good covering of elder leaves and a collection of over-eager imaginations, managed to convince us that two lesser whitethroat were in the bush. Well played, woodpigeon. Well played. Though beneath the central pylon a few plucked feathers of one of its brethren lay on the ground. On balance, I think the humans win that one.\n\nThe silence continued all the way around the reserve. An occasional burst of Cetti's warbler song, the odd farting house martin (and a few distant swift clinging on to summer), and the occasional wren. No willow warblers, and only a handful of chiffchaffs. But today was not a day for the songbirds. Funnel web spiders glowering from their vaulted ivory caverns in the gorse the most intriguing sight, and the most frequent, and delightful, sound being instead the market stall bickering of the terns overhead. The youngsters in particular make a sound like the last dregs of a ribena carton being desperately slurped through a straw with a hole in its kink.\n\n![spider](/assets/img/spider.jpg)\n\nWhich I heard today, but noted yesterday evening on my way to the south of West Warwick on another futile wild bird chase. This time the wild hypothesis being Temminck's stint, and the result of the experimental observations being a remarkably steady-bodied common sandpiper. Those small waders &mdash; even those as far apart in the book as the _calidris_ stints and _tringa_ sandpipers &mdash; can all look alike in the right conditions. With the right lack of rigour.\n\nNot so the **Black-tailed godwit**, who is _almost always_ a black-tailed godwit. Brick red below and a scalloped dark grey above, lightening in winter to platinum pale, but always that pink and black sword bill, the white lightning strike bar the length of the wing, and the swan on stilts elegance that perhaps only the avocet, among british waders, can surpass.

The welcome return of a few swifts, though behaving far more demurely than at their peak. A comedy of coots sprinting across the water like greyhounds charging from the gate at my approach. And raiding parties of cormorants charging at the sky like bats.\n\nQuite the day for the first young willow warbler of the season to return, far brighter than the parents and glowing yellow in the bushes despite the muted lighting.

I saw it with my own eyes yesterday &mdash; the breeding raft a ghost town, and the sky no longer a constant bickering bazaar of angelic birds. A handful still speckled the skies over Lockwood, but the character of the place has changed considerably. Combined with the blustery autumnal weather of the past few days, it feels like a decisive step towards winter. Whether sitting looking out at the raft, or traipsing around the reservoirs, a colder, lonelier season of birdwatching has arrived.\n\nSwifts are also delivering their last hurrahs. Only a few small groups passing through. Unlike the hundreds of house martins and dozens of sand martins still patronising our increasingly sunlight-challenged city. They will take another month to vanish. Methadone to wean me off the combined spectacle of terns and swifts demonstrating their individual aerial flair.\n\nAfter a week largely spent sitting and driving I got back on the bike today for an excursion slightly fut=rther afield, up to Gilberts Slade woods, where Epping Forest reaches a thin finger in towards Wanstead and tickles its bare belly with stands of impressively straight-trunked, mature oaks, haunted hornbeams and a few sun-kissed glades. \n\nUnder the trees I came across the woodland specialities of treecreeper and nuthatch almost instantly, and nearby a goldcrest and a female woodpecker, with an extremely bright red undertail &mdash; I'm not sure if it was the particular light conditions or fresh feathers following a moult, but it positively glowed, like the Miss Scarlet piece in an old Cluedo set.\n\nI paused in every slight clearing as I walked, as these woodland edges tend to be favoured by the flycatchers, redstarts and other rarer migrants that can drop in at this time of year. It eventually paid off with the discovery of a **Spotted Flycatcher** sitting proudly in the thin branches atop a dead birch tree. Not moving, \"I've been expecting you,\" it seemed to say, eyeing me with a supercilious composure. Eventually it flitted off, not treating me to a display of its flycatching prowess.\n\nSo I continued on towards Wanstead Flats, a great expanse of open grassland, scrub and small patches of woodland that's always good for late summer migrants. En route I saw a Hobby dashing overhead &mdash; perhaps another for my \"last of the summer\" bucket. I wonder if it was one of the birds we've been seeing regularly at Walthamstow. Wanstead's about three miles away &mdash; how big _are_ their territories?\n\nWanstead didn't disappoint. It's a remarkable habitat to find in a city, almost reminiscent of a mediterranean headland, with plenty of scraggly undergrowth for the skittish warblers and friends to find refuge in. A couple of years ago a big fire destroyed much of the area I was searching through, but it's recovered remarkably well. Great warped, bare black branches rising above the relatively puny new growth stand as a reminder of how overgrown this place used to be.\n\nWithin a few minutes a whitethroat stuck its head out into the open. While not a rare bird, there is something quite mystical about finding one at a migration hotspot. Where did it come from? Where is it going? The humdrum neighbour infused with all the romance of a year abroad.\n\nNext up the surprise of three siskin &mdash; more of a winter visitor usually &mdash; landing briefly in the birches before &mdash; perhaps realising they were unfashinably early &mdash; leaving almost immediately. Then back to the more usual suspects &mdash; two whinchat sitting tamely on the broom as dog walkers passed within barking distance, and both a lesser whitethroat and another whitethroat joning them. A little further along three more spotted flycatchers put on more of a show than my previous find, darting between perches, but seeming more interested in chasing each other than in catching flies.\n\nA couple of pipits flew over, calling weakly. There were supposed to be some tree pipits &mdash; a Wanstead speciality &mdash; about, but the insipid _seep seep_ calls told me these two were meadow pipits, one of our commonest birds (though on the Berwyn moors in Wales last week I saw such large numbers of them that even the humble, brown streaked meadow pipit managed to create a  spectacle). Just a moment later and tow more pipits flew overhead, calling more stridently, and circling a few times before landing in a nearby oak. Training my binoculars on it I saw the fine streaking on the sides and the pale belly that told me it was the sought after tree pipit. \n\nPipits are among the most difficult species of bird to identify. They can barely even be said to be variations on a theme as \"small, brown and streaky\" isn't much of a theme, and the variations require a watch-maker's eyeglass to pick out. \n\nSee for yourself:\n\n![tree pipit](/assets/img/tree-pipit.jpg)","src/data/birds/2020-08-31-spotted-flycatcher.md","1418d59e314ac85d",{"html":1772,"metadata":1773},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/spotted-flycatcher.jpg\" alt=\"spotted flycatcher\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The last few slivers of summer bird life continue their slow drift southwards, slinking out of the country with barely a wave goodbye.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Returning on friday from a week’s holiday in Wales and other northern haunts I saw the distressing message in the birding group that the tern colony had upped and left in the night.

Whether sitting looking out at the raft, or traipsing around the reservoirs, a colder, lonelier season of birdwatching has arrived.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Swifts are also delivering their last hurrahs. Only a few small groups passing through. Unlike the hundreds of house martins and dozens of sand martins still patronising our increasingly sunlight-challenged city. They will take another month to vanish. Methadone to wean me off the combined spectacle of terns and swifts demonstrating their individual aerial flair.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After a week largely spent sitting and driving I got back on the bike today for an excursion slightly fut=rther afield, up to Gilberts Slade woods, where Epping Forest reaches a thin finger in towards Wanstead and tickles its bare belly with stands of impressively straight-trunked, mature oaks, haunted hornbeams and a few sun-kissed glades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Under the trees I came across the woodland specialities of treecreeper and nuthatch almost instantly, and nearby a goldcrest and a female woodpecker, with an extremely bright red undertail — I’m not sure if it was the particular light conditions or fresh feathers following a moult, but it positively glowed, like the Miss Scarlet piece in an old Cluedo set.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I paused in every slight clearing as I walked, as these woodland edges tend to be favoured by the flycatchers, redstarts and other rarer migrants that can drop in at this time of year. It eventually paid off with the discovery of a \u003Cstrong>Spotted Flycatcher\u003C/strong> sitting proudly in the thin branches atop a dead birch tree. Not moving, “I’ve been expecting you,” it seemed to say, eyeing me with a supercilious composure. Eventually it flitted off, not treating me to a display of its flycatching prowess.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I continued on towards Wanstead Flats, a great expanse of open grassland, scrub and small patches of woodland that’s always good for late summer migrants. En route I saw a Hobby dashing overhead — perhaps another for my “last of the summer” bucket. I wonder if it was one of the birds we’ve been seeing regularly at Walthamstow. Wanstead’s about three miles away — how big \u003Cem>are\u003C/em> their territories?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wanstead didn’t disappoint. It’s a remarkable habitat to find in a city, almost reminiscent of a mediterranean headland, with plenty of scraggly undergrowth for the skittish warblers and friends to find refuge in. A couple of years ago a big fire destroyed much of the area I was searching through, but it’s recovered remarkably well. Great warped, bare black branches rising above the relatively puny new growth stand as a reminder of how overgrown this place used to be.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Within a few minutes a whitethroat stuck its head out into the open. While not a rare bird, there is something quite mystical about finding one at a migration hotspot. Where did it come from? Where is it going? The humdrum neighbour infused with all the romance of a year abroad.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Next up the surprise of three siskin — more of a winter visitor usually — landing briefly in the birches before — perhaps realising they were unfashinably early — leaving almost immediately. Then back to the more usual suspects — two whinchat sitting tamely on the broom as dog walkers passed within barking distance, and both a lesser whitethroat and another whitethroat joning them. A little further along three more spotted flycatchers put on more of a show than my previous find, darting between perches, but seeming more interested in chasing each other than in catching flies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A couple of pipits flew over, calling weakly. There were supposed to be some tree pipits — a Wanstead speciality — about, but the insipid \u003Cem>seep seep\u003C/em> calls told me these two were meadow pipits, one of our commonest birds (though on the Berwyn moors in Wales last week I saw such large numbers of them that even the humble, brown streaked meadow pipit managed to create a  spectacle). Just a moment later and tow more pipits flew overhead, calling more stridently, and circling a few times before landing in a nearby oak. Training my binoculars on it I saw the fine streaking on the sides and the pale belly that told me it was the sought after tree pipit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pipits are among the most difficult species of bird to identify. They can barely even be said to be variations on a theme as “small, brown and streaky” isn’t much of a theme, and the variations require a watch-maker’s eyeglass to pick out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>See for yourself:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/tree-pipit.jpg\" alt=\"tree pipit\">\u003C/p>",{"headings":1774,"localImagePaths":1775,"remoteImagePaths":1776,"frontmatter":1777,"imagePaths":1780},[],[],[],{"layout":27,"title":1762,"description":1764,"primaryTag":1353,"tags":1778,"date":1779},[628,417,543,441,1248,1247,673,853,1353,467,1766,1393,390,627,1745,1767],["Date","2020-08-31T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2020-09-27-gannet",{"id":1781,"data":1783,"body":1792,"filePath":1793,"digest":1794,"rendered":1795},{"title":1784,"date":1785,"description":1786,"primaryTag":1787,"tags":1788},"61 Boring Birds: #68 Gannet",["Date","2020-09-27T00:00:00.000Z"],"Lost in the city","Gannet",[1393,649,1309,627,1789,1790,1791,1787],"Stonechat","Greenland wheatear","Black-necked grebe","![gannet](/assets/img/gannet-head.jpg)\n\nI have been a terribly lazy blogger of late. \n\nThe birds of Walthamstow have been far from boring.

At the grandest scale, the right weather system pushing across the Atlantic or Siberia can, a day later, deposit a smattering of bewildered rarities on our shores. At the micro level, more often than not a mighty wind keeps the birds hunkered down in their brambley bunkers. At the mid scale, particularly at the coast, the wind can divert the migration paths of birds a few dozen &mdash; or perhaps hundreds &mdash; of miles, bringing birds destined for Holland or the German Bight onto the east coast of England, and pushing ocean wanderers, accustomed to life far from land, close enough to pick out as a tiny speck slaloming its way between the waves. But, for the skilled seawatcher (which I most definitely am not), these specks passing by the lens of a patiently watched telescope from time to time offer rich rewards for braving gales lashing against exposed coastal promontories.\n\nFor those of us living away from the coast, such storms will occasionally drive a few of these specks inland, where they &mdash; even they! &mdash; must take a break from the endless roaring of the wind and the waves.

It's curious how something can fade from one's daily routine after forming a crucial part of it's scaffolding, and be forgotten in little more than an instant.\n\nIt won't be the first or the last wholesome activity to have dropped well out of orbit during this second dreary lockdown. Back in March, for instance, my exercise routine peaked with a practically daily dose of core strength workouts, but now I mainly lie back on the sofa watching Jonathan Creek repeats. I aim to slither through winter.\n\nTruth be told, it wasn't until yesterday (I write this on the first of December) that I thought of this blog once more. \n\nAnd all for the love of a goose.\n\nOver the past few days I've spent an inordinate amount of time birdwatching. Taking a break from the drudgery of the poorly daylit home office. Not even the appearance of the first woodpecker of the winter at my bird feeder could assuage me of the firmly held feeling that hell is, despite what Sartre might thinnk, a distinct lack of people and a consiparacy of neighbouring terraces and trees to block out the light. Made worse by the fog.\n\n![siberian-chiffchaff](/assets/img/siberian-chiffchaff.jpg)\n\nBut birding loves a fog, confounding late autumn migrants' attempts to find the correct wintering grounds. Nothing too spectacular arrived over most of the long weekend, although I did, on Thursday afternoon, find a ghostly pale chiffchaff I then spent most of friday traipsing around the misty canalside woods attempting to refind, in the hope of hearing it call in a high-piteched russian accent and confirm that it was of the siberian variety.\n\nI didn't plan on getting up early on Monday to do the rounds, but the arrival of an early parcel from Amazon (a birthday present from Karen, whose mum is a regular reader I believe) at 7.30 coincided with a period of light sleep so I ventured out anyway, arriving at the reservoirs by the time gates opened at 8.\n\nThe morning fog, draping the new builds at Tottenham Hale and Blackhorse Road in mystique, formed the setting for a predictable morning's birdwatching. Along the entrance path, with coots on the lake, moorhens sprinting for cover and the odd black-headed gull nonchalantly swooning through the air, a variety of tits peeping from the bushes as I approach the bike rack, and a variety of dark and light specks scattered across the still surface of Lockwood as I gained the top of the steps up its bank, and looked out to count the cormorants resting on the dishevelled raft anchored near the south end.\n\nAnd nothing more alluring as I walked up the west bank. No sight nor sound of the yellow-browed warbler that's graced the reserve for about the last month, and no visible migration of thrushes overhead. But there was this goose...\n\nGeese are, from an identification standpoint, like the warblers and waders' big cousins. Many different species with broadly the same colouration and behaviour, with clues to their precise species lying in subtle nuances of behaviour and tiny colouration details. Birdwatching is a hobby where practice makes perfect, but geese (aside from a few commoner species) are not widespread enough to afford that kind of practice.\n\nSo when a goose I'd evidently frightened flew up from the bank and flew past on its way south before I could so much as get my binoculars onto it, all I had was an uncomfortable sensation that what was fading away into the fog was no journeyman goose. It appeared small, with a short, dark neck, and the wings lacked the light grey flashes that are so obvious on a flying greylag. Beyond that I did not have the chops to tell what exactly it was, although I guessed at pink-footed.\n\nIt flew on south, tracing a broad ark near the electricity pylons. I assumed it had gone beyond them but then, joyfully, it circled back, and after a couple of loops around the Maynard reservoirs came down somewhere around High Maynard.\n\nI set off as quickly as I could, not even pausing to look for the yellow-browed warbler when it picked that perfect moment to crave attention with its high pitched swanee whistle. Roudning the top end of Lockwood I slunk down from the top of the bank to the track at its base in order to conceal my silhouette, but creeping up on High Maynard I was confused to find no geese whatsoever.\n\nScratching my woolly-hatted head I climbed the bank again. Distracted by the antics of the kiss-chasing pied wagtails, I almost stumbled into the goose, casually grazing with some canada geese it had adopted as family. Unmistakably, it was a white-fronted goose. \n\nThere is nothing more beautiful than the ruffled neck of an adult goose. Like the lines left in the fur of a hirsute cat by an affectionate owners slightly splayed fingers, they have the beautiful deep, soft, many-shaded strata that makes one want to plunge straight in. Who knows what genius angel designed such rustic but refined detailing, but they did well.\n\nAnd the white-fronted goose wears this finery better than most. Somewhat toy-like, they waddle about like little Napoleons, necks held bolt upright and proud, tall foreheads emblazoned with a white flash giving them a proud, aristocratic air. Across their bellies a few messy transversal smudges of almost black incongruously muddy heir otherwise debonair appearance, but even this is carried off with the insoussiance of a prince caught in some compromising position, but having the temerity to complain about the intrusion.\n\nIt's the first one I've seen since, at the age of seven, visiting Slimbridge nature reserve in Somerset. That day was arguably the true genesis of my birdwatching ways; spending all of a rainy October day running around the wildfowl enclosures, ticking off various ducks and geese of the world from the handy guidebook that listed them all. I am vaguely aware of seeing the geese there, in the wild part of the reserve, but so much time has passed it hardly counts as a proper tick.

It’s curious how something can fade from one’s daily routine after forming a crucial part of it’s scaffolding, and be forgotten in little more than an instant.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It won’t be the first or the last wholesome activity to have dropped well out of orbit during this second dreary lockdown. Back in March, for instance, my exercise routine peaked with a practically daily dose of core strength workouts, but now I mainly lie back on the sofa watching Jonathan Creek repeats. I aim to slither through winter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Truth be told, it wasn’t until yesterday (I write this on the first of December) that I thought of this blog once more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And all for the love of a goose.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Over the past few days I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time birdwatching. Taking a break from the drudgery of the poorly daylit home office. Not even the appearance of the first woodpecker of the winter at my bird feeder could assuage me of the firmly held feeling that hell is, despite what Sartre might thinnk, a distinct lack of people and a consiparacy of neighbouring terraces and trees to block out the light. Made worse by the fog.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/siberian-chiffchaff.jpg\" alt=\"siberian-chiffchaff\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But birding loves a fog, confounding late autumn migrants’ attempts to find the correct wintering grounds. Nothing too spectacular arrived over most of the long weekend, although I did, on Thursday afternoon, find a ghostly pale chiffchaff I then spent most of friday traipsing around the misty canalside woods attempting to refind, in the hope of hearing it call in a high-piteched russian accent and confirm that it was of the siberian variety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I didn’t plan on getting up early on Monday to do the rounds, but the arrival of an early parcel from Amazon (a birthday present from Karen, whose mum is a regular reader I believe) at 7.30 coincided with a period of light sleep so I ventured out anyway, arriving at the reservoirs by the time gates opened at 8.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The morning fog, draping the new builds at Tottenham Hale and Blackhorse Road in mystique, formed the setting for a predictable morning’s birdwatching. Along the entrance path, with coots on the lake, moorhens sprinting for cover and the odd black-headed gull nonchalantly swooning through the air, a variety of tits peeping from the bushes as I approach the bike rack, and a variety of dark and light specks scattered across the still surface of Lockwood as I gained the top of the steps up its bank, and looked out to count the cormorants resting on the dishevelled raft anchored near the south end.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And nothing more alluring as I walked up the west bank. No sight nor sound of the yellow-browed warbler that’s graced the reserve for about the last month, and no visible migration of thrushes overhead. But there was this goose…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Geese are, from an identification standpoint, like the warblers and waders’ big cousins. Many different species with broadly the same colouration and behaviour, with clues to their precise species lying in subtle nuances of behaviour and tiny colouration details. Birdwatching is a hobby where practice makes perfect, but geese (aside from a few commoner species) are not widespread enough to afford that kind of practice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So when a goose I’d evidently frightened flew up from the bank and flew past on its way south before I could so much as get my binoculars onto it, all I had was an uncomfortable sensation that what was fading away into the fog was no journeyman goose. It appeared small, with a short, dark neck, and the wings lacked the light grey flashes that are so obvious on a flying greylag. Beyond that I did not have the chops to tell what exactly it was, although I guessed at pink-footed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It flew on south, tracing a broad ark near the electricity pylons. I assumed it had gone beyond them but then, joyfully, it circled back, and after a couple of loops around the Maynard reservoirs came down somewhere around High Maynard.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I set off as quickly as I could, not even pausing to look for the yellow-browed warbler when it picked that perfect moment to crave attention with its high pitched swanee whistle. Roudning the top end of Lockwood I slunk down from the top of the bank to the track at its base in order to conceal my silhouette, but creeping up on High Maynard I was confused to find no geese whatsoever.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Scratching my woolly-hatted head I climbed the bank again. Distracted by the antics of the kiss-chasing pied wagtails, I almost stumbled into the goose, casually grazing with some canada geese it had adopted as family. Unmistakably, it was a white-fronted goose.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is nothing more beautiful than the ruffled neck of an adult goose. Like the lines left in the fur of a hirsute cat by an affectionate owners slightly splayed fingers, they have the beautiful deep, soft, many-shaded strata that makes one want to plunge straight in. Who knows what genius angel designed such rustic but refined detailing, but they did well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the white-fronted goose wears this finery better than most. Somewhat toy-like, they waddle about like little Napoleons, necks held bolt upright and proud, tall foreheads emblazoned with a white flash giving them a proud, aristocratic air. Across their bellies a few messy transversal smudges of almost black incongruously muddy heir otherwise debonair appearance, but even this is carried off with the insoussiance of a prince caught in some compromising position, but having the temerity to complain about the intrusion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s the first one I’ve seen since, at the age of seven, visiting Slimbridge nature reserve in Somerset. That day was arguably the true genesis of my birdwatching ways; spending all of a rainy October day running around the wildfowl enclosures, ticking off various ducks and geese of the world from the handy guidebook that listed them all. I am vaguely aware of seeing the geese there, in the wild part of the reserve, but so much time has passed it hardly counts as a proper tick. Nonetheless, I was bought my first proper birdbook from the Slimbridge gift shop, and to this day it still has the ticks a seven year old version of myself penned childishly next to the names of the birds I’d seen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/white-fronted-book.jpg\" alt=\"white-fronted-book\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I posted news of the goose on the whatsapp group, to be informed that it was one of many that had turned up in unexpected places that morning, including one in Regent’s Park!

It's not the birds' fault, nor the weather's, nor the ever peaceful surroundings of the lower Lea valley. \n\nIf I have an excuse it's that a week of over-warm afternoons dulled enjoyment of anything and everything, and I am a creature of great inertia. Which is to dress up the fact I'm a lazy bastard, particularly when it's too hot.\n\nSo what have you been missing? Rather a lot, as it happens.\n\nSummer continues to wind down. Blackcaps no longer sing, reed warblers utter the odd short sequence of churrs &mdash; a pale shadow of May's rap battles &mdash; and the sedge warblers have all but vanished. Only the Cetti's warblers sing with any enthusiasm &mdash; apparently, being non-migratory, now is the time of year for this year's young to establish territories. The flocks of tits and warblers still roam the waterside willows looking for food, though the number of willow warblers remains low, yet to reach its post breeding peak.\n\nOn the day the rains finally hit (well, that first day they dribbled, all told) I walked around Lockwood in the early evening to feel the drizzle on my skin and search for waders. A few common sandpipers, as always (I counted 15 by the end), but the highlights were my first wheatear of the autumn and a young peregrine treating the top corner of the lake like an werial velodrome, circling several times low down before eventually departing for Tottenham. The ducks and coots remained remarkably calm, somehow sensing something amateurish in the young an ineffective birds movements. On another of the reservoirs a heron &mdash; a more seasoned predator apparently &mdash; swallowed a large red-finned fish whole (a roach, I believe). And a cool, quiet kingfisher whirred from one shady spot on a wooded island to another, in search of smaller prey. After a notable absence in the spring (they usually breed here), one or two have returned for the winter.\n\nSome of the commoner resident birds' habits are changing with the season too. Collared doves have, after hiding away in the residential streets for a long while, started to become more common on site, with little flocks of twos, threes and fours popping up all over the place. I have a soft spot for these dainty, least vermin-like pigeons. Linnet numbers are still high, with a flock of around 40 one day, and today I saw my biggest starling gathering of the summer &mdash; around 200 birds feeding at the riding paddocks.\n\nAt the wekend I ventured out of London properly for the first time since February, and it will not surprise you to know that it was in search of a bird. Only just North of the city limits and cycleable, were it not for the unpredictable downpours and post-heatwave lethargy, I nevertheless took the train to Amwell in Hertfordshire, where a Temminck's stint has been spending the last few days doing its common sandpiper's baby sibling routine in full view of the only part of the reserve still properly open to the birdwatching public &mdash; how considerate of it. A new species for me and it was gratifying that it \"performed\" well enough for me to convince myself that I _could_ have picked it out and identified it myself. \n\nWhile there I pointed it out to a journeyman with binoculars. I asked if he knew where was best to look for the stint and, despite looking more the birdwatching part than I do &mdash; green anorak, bulky binoculars and over fifty &mdash; it turns out that he and his friend were mainly doing a spot of _fish_-watching, a pastime I had no idea existed. After I pointed him in the direction of the sparrow-sized wader trotting about the ducks like an antelope around the elephants, he told me they'd only stopped off briefly at the viewpoint on the way to look for some carp, and didn't really know too much about birds. It's quite refreshing ot have this sort of chat from time to time. Keeps things interesting.\n\nI returned to London and Walthamstow and wetlands in the mid afternoon, just in time for the rain proper to arrive. A walk around the Warwicks, all the numbered reservoirs, and East Warwick again gave me a soaking wet pair of trousers, a daliance with a lapwing that'd taken up residence for a couple of days and a visceral sense of being. That is more than adequate compensation for the bloody-minded reluctance of the rare birds to drop down for a break from the downpour. As, after three hours, the rain drew back into the cloud like a card trick, I listened to the herring gulls heralding their triumph over the storm, and waltzed back home.\n\nYesterday was, finally, to have been the day I sat down to write. Tales and tales and tales to tell, and a morning off work to do so. The early morning stroll saw plenty of colour. The largest swift gathering in weeks (around 50 birds) marched around the sky in a fairly regimented peloton. They were joined by a few sand martins and the local colony of housemartins, who have not even _begun_ to think about leaving yet. Over on West Warwick my first common gull of autumn rested its tired body atop a post, and a dwindling number of sandpipers (I counted only three) peeped from the safety of their rocky perches. \n\nApproaching No. 5 a disgruntled, but eventually convivial, fly fisherman (who mistook my mumbled reply to a good morning as an aloof ghosting before I put him straight) told me about the constant feud between his kind and the coarse, carp fisherman. He pointed to his net and rod carrier &mdash; only slightly bulkier than the snooker player's kit &mdash; and said the carp fisherman are jealous of how light they travel. Their rivalry recalls those that might exist between cavalry and infantry, RAF and navy. And there was me thinking they were all on the same fish torturing, bird entangling side. He pointed towards the dozens of large trout paddling about in the shallows, dorsal fins and tail-tips slicing the surface. He tells me they're difficult to catch, though he caught one the other day. I can't imagine they are very motivated to chase after flies, real or otherwise. I keep seeing them dead &mdash; in the water, belly up, or on land, rotting and eyeless &mdash; and I think now must be the season to mate and make way for the young.\n\nSo home. To write.\n\nAnd the phone tells me a pied flycatcher has been seen on Tottenham marsh. Given a choice between spending an hour writing about birds, and spending an hour looking for a delightful little black and white creature... I don't need to tell you which one won _that_ contest. Leading myself and a few others up the garden path for about half an hour, I eventually refound it flitting discretely between a large sycamore and a large hawthorn. Its pied plumage had faded to post-breeding greys, and it looked not unlike a neat chaffinch from behind, but still a big-eyed, plump treat to view up close.\n\nSo this morning I set off across Walthamstow marsh in search of my very own migratory treat &mdash; delightful though \"other people's\" birds are, it's always so much more rewarding to find your own.\n\nBut almost nothing around in the pleasantly damp morning air, save for one of the kestrels that appear to have bred successfully locally.\n\nAnd then the rain.\n\nAnd an intense day of work.\n\nBoth of which ended at 6 o'clock on the dot, and suggested how I might end my day.\n\nAgain, the drizzly aftermath of a downpour and again a lengthy traipse around the reservoirs dredged up no waterlogged rare terns or waders seeking shelter. But the trees were, at least, alive with small birds, cramming in as many insects as they could in the narrow window of opportunity between fly-swatting deluge and hunt-calming night. As I walked along the west banks of No's 4 & 5 I came across several small flocks, although the area around the fisherman's hut was oddly quiet. Towards the north end, with the light dying and looking into the diffused, but still silhouette inducing, brightness of the sun through the clouds, I paid unusually close attention to surely the last flock of the day I'd pass, despite the poor visibility. I think I was hoping for  goldcrest, which are always enjoyable to watch, and was also briefly enchanted by a thoroughly wetted reed warbler.\n\nAnd then I saw it. A head with a very prominent yellow supercillium (eyebrow) poking out from behind a leaf. In the time honoured birdwatcher's rapid rifling through the mental filofax I arrived at the possibility of it being a **Wood Warbler** &mdash; the yellow was lemony, the eyebrow flared out at the back (as opposed to the willow warblers more \"plucked\" and under control facial grooming) and there was just something quite strong about its facial expression. The willow warbler, I feel, looks as if it was playing in mum's make-up box when it drew on its eyebrows &mdash; a child's idea of how it's supposed to look &mdash; whereas the wood warbler has the confidently overstyled panache of a new romantic.\n\nNot quite enough to go on, I prowled about the willow tree for what seemed like hours, and was about to put out the word to look out for a _possible_ wood warbler in the morning when the thinning flock rendezvoused once more on the edge of the clearing I stood at. I watched a long-winged, dark-backed, biggish warbler swoop out of the leaves, turn its bright white belly up and dive back in again. Over the next few minutes I found it a few more times, getting a good long look at its crisply clean features before it and its coterie of commoner types vanished into the gloaming once more.\n\nThsi has been a long post, I know, but indulge me a little longer.\n\nA litle while ago I was talking to Dave who, when I told him about the whinchat I'd found, confided that the male whinchat is his favourite British bird, which got me to thinking; I have a _favourite_ bird &mdash; The alpine chough, for [obvious reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOdWFRX1lj0) &mdash; but it's not found in Britain. So I drew up a shortlist of what my favourite bird might be. Turnstone was a contender (this was on the day I just missed one at the Wetlands), as was Lesser Whitethroat (a neater bird you will not find), and the little tern (_pluck_ in a bird), but I eventually settled on wood warbler.\n\nThey have the most astonishingly beautiful song, and sing it in the most beautiful settings. Last year myself and some friends rented a place in the highlands and in the woods next door a wood warbler sang. I traipsed up the slope, following its superlative trill from tree to tree until I foudn it perched a little above head height, its entire body shivering with effort of delivering each mellifluous phrase. The first time I ever saw and heard one was in the Lake District, at the age of about eleven. I was bored and waiting for my mum to finish some social gathering with the Wrexham Rambling Club, and so walked out of the end of the hotel's garden and a little up the neighbouring wooded slope, where I stood in a natural amphitheatre of hillside and cavernous old oak canopy and soaked up the stupefying sounds this tiny bird was creating.\n\n\u003Caudio controls>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/wood-warbler.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\u003C/audio>\n\nI think this roughly coincides with when I started to properly birdwatch; I knew enough to know it was a warbler, but mistakenly identified it as a willow warbler at first, so evidently hadn't been at it very long if I still didn't recognise one of our commonest summer birds.\n\nSo me and the wood warbler go _waaaaay_ back. And now, as if to reward me for remembering it in the tight race to be crowned \"Bird of Britain\", one turns up on my doorstep. Scarce in Wales and the North, wood warblers are a real treat in London. By far the rarest bird I've found myself, only a few will be seen in London this year, and it's one of only a [handful ever seen at the reservoirs](http://walthamstowbirders.blogspot.com/2016/04/podium-finish.html).\n\nHours later, still a little damp from the downpour that followed soon after, and growing tired of the time spent today at the computer, I am, however,  still smiling.\n\n![rain island](/assets/img/rain-island.jpg)\n\n[Main image credit](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flickr_-_Rainbirder_-_Wood_Warbler_(Phylloscopus_sibilatrix).jpg)","src/data/birds/2020-08-19-wood-warbler.md","8a45a87a34894f2f",{"html":1842,"metadata":1843},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/wood-warbler.jpg\" alt=\"wood warbler\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Forgive me, for I have been a lazy diarist, a foot-dragging chronologer, a tardy almanacker.

In the time honoured birdwatcher’s rapid rifling through the mental filofax I arrived at the possibility of it being a \u003Cstrong>Wood Warbler\u003C/strong> — the yellow was lemony, the eyebrow flared out at the back (as opposed to the willow warblers more “plucked” and under control facial grooming) and there was just something quite strong about its facial expression. The willow warbler, I feel, looks as if it was playing in mum’s make-up box when it drew on its eyebrows — a child’s idea of how it’s supposed to look — whereas the wood warbler has the confidently overstyled panache of a new romantic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not quite enough to go on, I prowled about the willow tree for what seemed like hours, and was about to put out the word to look out for a \u003Cem>possible\u003C/em> wood warbler in the morning when the thinning flock rendezvoused once more on the edge of the clearing I stood at. I watched a long-winged, dark-backed, biggish warbler swoop out of the leaves, turn its bright white belly up and dive back in again. Over the next few minutes I found it a few more times, getting a good long look at its crisply clean features before it and its coterie of commoner types vanished into the gloaming once more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thsi has been a long post, I know, but indulge me a little longer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A litle while ago I was talking to Dave who, when I told him about the whinchat I’d found, confided that the male whinchat is his favourite British bird, which got me to thinking; I have a \u003Cem>favourite\u003C/em> bird — The alpine chough, for \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOdWFRX1lj0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">obvious reasons\u003C/a> — but it’s not found in Britain. So I drew up a shortlist of what my favourite bird might be. Turnstone was a contender (this was on the day I just missed one at the Wetlands), as was Lesser Whitethroat (a neater bird you will not find), and the little tern (\u003Cem>pluck\u003C/em> in a bird), but I eventually settled on wood warbler.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They have the most astonishingly beautiful song, and sing it in the most beautiful settings. Last year myself and some friends rented a place in the highlands and in the woods next door a wood warbler sang. I traipsed up the slope, following its superlative trill from tree to tree until I foudn it perched a little above head height, its entire body shivering with effort of delivering each mellifluous phrase. The first time I ever saw and heard one was in the Lake District, at the age of about eleven. I was bored and waiting for my mum to finish some social gathering with the Wrexham Rambling Club, and so walked out of the end of the hotel’s garden and a little up the neighbouring wooded slope, where I stood in a natural amphitheatre of hillside and cavernous old oak canopy and soaked up the stupefying sounds this tiny bird was creating.\u003C/p>\n\u003Caudio controls>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/wood-warbler.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n\u003C/audio>\n\u003Cp>I think this roughly coincides with when I started to properly birdwatch; I knew enough to know it was a warbler, but mistakenly identified it as a willow warbler at first, so evidently hadn’t been at it very long if I still didn’t recognise one of our commonest summer birds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So me and the wood warbler go \u003Cem>waaaaay\u003C/em> back. And now, as if to reward me for remembering it in the tight race to be crowned “Bird of Britain”, one turns up on my doorstep. Scarce in Wales and the North, wood warblers are a real treat in London. By far the rarest bird I’ve found myself, only a few will be seen in London this year, and it’s one of only a \u003Ca href=\"http://walthamstowbirders.blogspot.com/2016/04/podium-finish.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">handful ever seen at the reservoirs\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hours later, still a little damp from the downpour that followed soon after, and growing tired of the time spent today at the computer, I am, however,  still smiling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/img/rain-island.jpg\" alt=\"rain island\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flickr_-_Rainbirder_-_Wood_Warbler_(Phylloscopus_sibilatrix).jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Main image credit\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":1844,"localImagePaths":1845,"remoteImagePaths":1846,"frontmatter":1847,"imagePaths":1850},[],[],[],{"layout":27,"title":1829,"description":1831,"primaryTag":1832,"tags":1848,"date":1849},[495,493,918,1560,828,1834,388,852,1124,1436,716,413,1835,940,418,417,441,543,1836,1837,651,1832],["Date","2020-08-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[],"2021-01-01-caspian-gull",{"id":1851,"data":1853,"body":1861,"filePath":1862,"digest":1863,"rendered":1864},{"title":1854,"date":1855,"description":1856,"primaryTag":1857,"tags":1858},"61 Boring Birds: #70 Caspian Gull",["Date","2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"Auld lang snout","Caspian Gull",[1859,1860,1857],"Redwing","Scaup","![caspian-over-shoulder](/assets/img/caspian-over-shoulder.jpg)\n\nNew year's day &mdash; hangover notwithstanding &mdash; is a wonderful day to go birdwatching, and most denizens of the wetlands patch were out and about to see in the new birding year.\n\nIs this because of some unusual symbiosis between humans and our feathered friends?

So we turned to graph technologies – Neo4j and GraphQL – to build a user-friendly picture of multiple AWS accounts. This helps keep our data more secure, saves us money, improves engineering efficiency, and provides instant insights that would previously have taken hours or days of research.\n\nIn this session, I share the things that graph allows them to do and outline how you can do something similar using a largely open source set of tools.\n\n- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vblSC1kShI)\n\n## ServerFULL: Working with and against state in Lambda \n### AWS Community Summit, July 2020\nThe documentation and marketing of AWS Lambda strongly suggest that state is not preserved between Lambda invocations. In this talk, I explore the nuances behind this. I share, with the help of some operational incidents, when it is, and isn't, safe to use state in a node.js application running on Lambda.\n\n- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUlDzAT69M)\n\n## Graph vs graph: GraphQL as the API for your Graph Database \n### GraphQL Days, Bodensee, September 2019\nMost stories of GraphQL implementations focus on retrofitting a GraphQL layer on top of existing APIs to surface the data's graphiness.

So we turned to graph technologies – Neo4j and GraphQL – to build a user-friendly picture of multiple AWS accounts. This helps keep our data more secure, saves us money, improves engineering efficiency, and provides instant insights that would previously have taken hours or days of research.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this session, I share the things that graph allows them to do and outline how you can do something similar using a largely open source set of tools.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vblSC1kShI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Video\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"serverfull-working-with-and-against-state-in-lambda\">ServerFULL: Working with and against state in Lambda\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"aws-community-summit-july-2020\">AWS Community Summit, July 2020\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The documentation and marketing of AWS Lambda strongly suggest that state is not preserved between Lambda invocations.
