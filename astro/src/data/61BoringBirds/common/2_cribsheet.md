Today, for me, even more than yesterday, is what this blog's all about. Going looking for something common but magnificent (the song thrush), accept the playful substitue (the sedge warbler), draw within touching distance of a superstar (the hobby), and yet find the most pleasure in the familiar and understated swallow.

Even when the world of birds is stood relatively still, nature's serendipitous paw has plenty of gems to reveal. If only we give our eyes and ears willingly to it.


Juvenile pied wagtail
I've needed to put the cover on my bins
I shouts yah block goes to the wind and the rain quoting what's his name from clockwork Orange. One minor characters, they're playing a pivotal role, the more as a plot device. Becomes a violent police officer later
Gulls and a great tit of the first call after the rain
A subtle low rainbow
Huge clouds escaping east
The underside of the clouds polypped and swollen like a sow's belly






White eye diamonds beneath its tail. It barely red Doc Martin black throat
They swallow is 2 to to Martin's as the Artic turn is to the Comintern

At the moment goose parents often outnumber the checks


A whitethroat, three Sand Martins, I literally  squeals with joy at the swifts
Like Stuart Lee "I got nothing" so I come birdwatching everyday
An invasion of Blackthorn into the reed warblers home. It perches atop anyway
The underside of the clouds polypped and swollen like a sow's belly

Ducklings stranded on a bed of algae
Goldfinches sounding like sand Martins
A Canada Goose stretches to eat that all seedheads of the maturing grass

Hey herons stalked out of the bush onto the lawn saw me and scarpered
I chased a second djay of the day home
A retinue of midges waiting at my front door







The hobby is the hunter of swifts… and dragonflies (damsels)
My first sight of a hobby was one of those unverified optimistic teenage moments. One for there to be confirmed list. The second sighting was of magical dragon birds in Reading. Boats life is not unlike lockdown. I am developing a stoop
 It's no longer the child star.


A hobby is a hawk and it hawks. Swifts also hawk. The Hawk hawks the hawks
Wood pigeon the hawk alike



Lesser white throat are early season performers, but their goal rate drops off
Reed warblers churr, like a ruler on a desk at its highest setting

Bramble flowers(of course because later berries. Also looks like strawberry flowers. Strawberries are so called because there found on the ground among the straw)
Dry grass, Green haws
Reed warbler duet. The female singer or a rival. Linked to podcast
Swallow— Liquid, low over water. How instantly I knew even with the naked eye

I returns to check if it was two swallows. Something I never do, retrace my steps

You might notice a theme emerging here; the quest for the quintessentially boring bird will be fruitless because no such bird exists (even the coot, which I despise, has a story behind that attitude)

A minor thing going on in my life right now. I'm reading a book about curlews while also reading a lot of tweets about curfews, and skim reading gets quite confusing. If only it were curlews being deployed across America. I could support that.

Scissor tails versus needle tail


Swifts bunch and move through the air in swirling cloud like a swarm of locusts

They are like this every year
They like this EVERY YEAR!

My heart is broken
hirundines etc depart in dribs and drabs - swifts just vanish
Do others even see swifts? Did I miss them in other years? How is it possible to see anything else??

Oh my days
The Swifts are still flying in the thunderstorm

Little man legs

Still lots of birds feeding over the water even though there seem to be fewer insects today. At least fewer bothering me. Hi am not attuned to this world of insects. They are not a priority for me. Likewise the swallows Polly haven't noticed the reduction in traffic it's locked down
