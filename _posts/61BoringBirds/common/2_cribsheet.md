Today, for me, even more than yesterday, is what this blog's all about. Going looking for something common but magnificent (the song thrush), accept the playful substitue (the sedge warbler), draw within touching distance of a superstar (the hobby), and yet find the most pleasure in the familiar and understated swallow.

Even when the world of birds is stood relatively still, nature's serendipitous paw has plenty of gems to reveal. If only we give our eyes and ears willingly to it.


Juvenile pied wagtail
I've needed to put the cover on my bins
I shouts yah block goes to the wind and the rain quoting what's his name from clockwork Orange. One minor characters, they're playing a pivotal role, the more as a plot device. Becomes a violent police officer later
Gulls and a great tit of the first call after the rain
A subtle low rainbow
Huge clouds escaping east
The underside of the clouds polypped and swollen like a sow's belly






White eye diamonds beneath its tail. It barely red Doc Martin black throat
They swallow is 2 to to Martin's as the Artic turn is to the Comintern
Glossy blue, particularly on the shoulders. In the sun after the rain

Passing trains



A black teenager with goosefeathers in his Afro
A monster toddler in a bike helmet running at a goose
Following a bird in the binoculars it's a skill that I didn't realise is skill
A tern also hawking from insects



Rogue Sparrow at Lakeside






At the moment goose parents often outnumber the checks


A whitethroat, three Sand Martins, I literally  squeals with joy at the swifts
Like Stuart Lee "I got nothing" so I come birdwatching everyday
An invasion of Blackthorn into the reed warblers home. It perches atop anyway
The underside of the clouds polypped and swollen like a sow's belly

Ducklings stranded on a bed of algae
Goldfinches sounding like sand Martins
A Canada Goose stretches to eat that all seedheads of the maturing grass

Hey herons stalked out of the bush onto the lawn saw me and scarpered
I chased a second djay of the day home
A retinue of midges waiting at my front door







The hobby is the hunter of swifts… and dragonflies (damsels)
My first sight of a hobby was one of those unverified optimistic teenage moments. One for there to be confirmed list. The second sighting was of magical dragon birds in Reading. Boats life is not unlike lockdown. I am developing a stoop
 It's no longer the child star.


A hobby is a hawk and it hawks. Swifts also hawk. The Hawk hawks the hawks
Wood pigeon the hawk alike



Lesser white throat are early season performers, but their goal rate drops off
Reed warblers churr, like a ruler on a desk at its highest setting
Black cap tack
Whitethroats buzz and makes sounds like police sirens in the 1980s computer games
Collared doves are surprisingly infrequent
Little grebe song
Only one son Martin and one house Martin

A Reed bunting in the brambles. It makes its glaswgian call: see you

Bramble flowers(of course because later berries. Also looks like strawberry flowers. Strawberries are so called because there found on the ground among the straw)
Dry grass, Green haws
Reed warbler duet. The female singer or a rival. Linked to podcast
Swallow— Liquid, low over water. How instantly I knew even with the naked eye

I returns to check if it was two swallows. Something I never do, retrace my steps

The house martins, 

flying over my shoulder 20cm away. heard in my ear - what are you saying, little one?


HM - longer forked, more frequently spread tail. both can look surorisingly 'cwt' in the back

I see through my twilit window that they are still not done.

You might notice a theme emerging here; the quest for the quintessentially boring bird will be fruitless because no such bird exists (even the coot, which I despise, has a story behind that attitude)

A minor thing going on in my life right now. I'm reading a book about curlews while also reading a lot of tweets about curfews, and skim reading gets quite confusing. If only it were curlews being deployed across America. I could support that.




propel
throbbig trembling tremulous
Circumscribed trajectories
frenzied


Albania



Scissor tails versus needle tail


Swifts bunch and move through the air in swirling cloud like a swarm of locusts

They are like this every year
They like this EVERY YEAR!

My heart is broken
hirundines etc depart in dribs and drabs - swifts just vanish
Do others even see swifts? Did I miss them in other years? How is it possible to see anything else??

Oh my days
The Swifts are still flying in the thunderstorm

streaked


Little man legs





3rd
swifts low but not so low

4th
swifts higher up and concentrated at far end and No4 - shy, like deer
martins form orderly queues while swifts are renegade soldiers of fortune
lone swift cry

watched 1 wift figure-8ing

low is exciting, but they have been super low - is the best


swift tower recording, falling numbers, malta

I can see th eedge of the swift maelstrom from my window as I write this (my flat is tantalisingly close to having a view of the reservoirs, but low elevation and another row of houses thwart that aspiration)

swift cloud swirl

surprising skill of refinding a moving bird in the bins

Fishermen in camouflage gear more than birders… Why??

Geese huddled in the downwind corner
Localised windy parts–topographically exposed

Juvenile pied wagtail
Camouflage fatigued
A few gulls, two turns battling the wind
Daisies and a white throat
Two stock doves
Song thrush and Robin competing
No seabirds today
Cygnet flapping its wings
Unnoticed epping hill
Even feral pigeons are playing chicken with me in this wind
I kicked a glass cigar of flints down the slope

I heard a kingfisher while following chinny




Still lots of birds feeding over the water even though there seem to be fewer insects today. At least fewer bothering me. Hi am not attuned to this world of insects. They are not a priority for me. Likewise the swallows Polly haven't noticed the reduction in traffic it's locked down
