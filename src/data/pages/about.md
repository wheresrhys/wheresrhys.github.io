description: About Rhys Evans, the person

Hello, I'm Rhys.

I struggle to say what I am these days, but I've been an administrator for a website, an editor, dabbled in UX, a front-end developer, a web performance specialist, worked on a data and analytics platform, written lots of developer tooling, and now find myself working in my employer's version of a Site Reliabilty Engineering team. My employer's the [FT](www.ft.com), by the way.

I like to think I've carried over a lot of experience and knowledge from my previous incarnations along with me, and now do a passable job of tackling any tech problem that's put in front of me and the teams I lead.

I would do anything for love, but I won't transpile.

I would _love it_ if you donated some money to [Refugee Support](https://www.refugeesupport.eu/donate/), a charity very close to my heart.

The dots and swirls in the background are inspired by [this video from numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAja2jp1VjE).
